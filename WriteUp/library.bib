@article{Wallach1992,
abstract = {A model was developed to predict the potential contamination of overland flow by chemicals removed from soil water by rainfall on sloping soil. The model accounts for transient water infiltration, overland flow and convective-dispersive solute transport in the soil. Solutes are assumed to be subjected to linear equilibrium sorption onto the soil's solid phase. Numerical simulations indicated that the value of the coefficient for soil chemical transfer to surface runoff does not affect the soil surface concentration when soil is initially dry, but is linearly related to the dissolved chemical flux to overland flow. This enables an approximate solution to the convective-dispersive equation for determining soil surface concentration, independent of its determination from rainfall-runoff relationships. Simulated dissolved chemical concentrations at the soil surface and in surface runoff were determined for different antecedent soil moistures and rainfall intensities. These concentrations were found to be lower when antecedent moisture was low, because ponding time for drier soils is longer and during this period soil solutes are therefore displaced downward by greater volumes of infiltrating water. For a specified initial soilwater content, higher rainfall rates cause higher dissolved chemical concentrations at the soil surface and in runoff water. The hydrological parameters (e.g. soil-surface slope, length and roughness) affecting the residence time of surface water on the field, greatly affect runoff concentration for a short time after the initiation of overland flow. The runoff concentration for longer periods is mainly affected by soil surface concentration, which is in turn controlled by the dispersion of the chemicals in the soil. The distribution coefficient between the liquid and solid phases of the soil controls the release of adsorbed chemicals to the soil solution and therefore affects the runoff concentration.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding and modelling the relationship between rainfall and runoff has been a driving force in hydrology for many years. Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each. The new baseflow separation method presented here (the bump and rise method or BRM) aims to accurately simulate the shape of tracer-determined baseflow or pre-event water. Application of the method by calibrating its parameters, using (a) tracer data or (b) an optimising method, is demonstrated for the Glendhu Catchment, New Zealand. The calibrated BRM algorithm is then applied to the Glendhu streamflow record. The new recession approach advances the thesis that recession analysis of streamflow alone gives misleading information on catchment storage reservoirs because streamflow is a varying mixture of components of very different origins and characteristics (at the simplest level, quickflow and baseflow as identified by the BRM method). Recession analyses of quickflow, baseflow and streamflow show that the steep power-law slopes often observed for streamflow at intermediate flows are artefacts due to mixing and are not representative of catchment reservoirs. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis could therefore shed new light on water storage reservoirs in catchments and possibly resolve some current problems with recession analysis. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs in the studied catchment have (non-linear) quadratic characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The paper introduces a semi-distributed hydro- logical model, suitable for continuous simulations, based upon the use of daily and hourly time steps. The model is called Distributed model for Runoff, Evapotranspiration, and Antecedent soil Moisture simulation (DREAM). It includes a daily water budget and an ``event scale'' hourly rainfall-runoff module. The two modules may be used separately or in cas- cade for continuous simulation. The main advantages of this approach lay in the robust and physically based parameteri- zation, which allows use of prior information and measurable data for parameter estimation. The proposed model was applied over four medium-sized basins in southern Italy, exhibiting considerable differences in climate and other physical characteristics. The capabilities of the two modules (daily and hourly) and of the combined runs were tested against measured data.},

abstract = {Species composition affects the carbon turnover and the formation and emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in wetlands. Here we investigate the individual effects of vascular plant species on the carbon cycling in a wetland ecosystem. We used a novel combination of laboratory methods and controlled environment facilities and studied three different vascular plant species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex rostrata and Juncus effusus) collected from the same wetland in southern Sweden. We found distinct differences in the functioning of these wetland sedges in terms of their effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes, bubble emission of CH4, decomposition of C-14-labelled acetate into (CH4)-C-14 and (CO2)-C-14, rhizospheric oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and stimulation of methanogenesis through root exudation of substrate ( e. g., acetate). The results show that the emission of CH4 from peat - plant monoliths was highest when the vegetation was dominated by Carex (6.76 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than when it was dominated by Eriophorum (2.38 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) or Juncus (2.68 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Furthermore, the CH4 emission seemed controlled primarily by the degree of rhizospheric CH4 oxidation which was between 20 and 40{\%} for Carex but {\textgreater} 90{\%} for both the other species. Our results point toward a direct and very important linkage between the plant species composition and the functioning of wetland ecosystems and indicate that changes in the species composition may alter important processes relating to controls of and interactions between greenhouse gas fluxes with significant implications for feedback mechanisms in a changing climate as a result.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands for water cleanup have been in use for several years and are promising for cost-efficient remediation of large scale contamination. Within this study, flow conditions in layered vertical soil filters used for remediation of contaminated groundwater were investigated in detail by special discharge experiments and an attuned modeling study. Unsaturated water flow was measured in two vertical flow constructed wetlands for contaminated groundwater treatment at a site in eastern Germany. Numerical simulations were performed using the code MIN3P, in which variably saturated flow is based on the Richards equation. Soil hydraulic functions based on Van Genuchten coefficients and preferential flow characteristics were obtained by calibrating the model to measured data using self-adaptive evolution strategies with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES). The presented inverse modeling procedure not only provides best fit parameterizations for separate and joint model objectives, but also utilizes the information from multiple restarts of the optimization algorithm to determine suitable parameter ranges and reveal potential correlations. The sequential automatic calibration is both straightforward and efficient even if different complex objective functions are considered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lindahl2005,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify the main sources of variation in pesticide losses at field and catchment scales using the dual permeability model MACRO. Stochastic simulations of the leaching of the herbicide MCPA (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid) were compared with seven years of measured concentrations in a stream draining a small agricultural catchment and one year of measured concentrations at the outlet of a field located within the catchment. MACRO was parameterized from measured probability distributions accounting for spatial variability of soil properties and local pedotransfer functions derived from information gathered in field- and catchment-scale soil surveys. At the field scale, a single deterministic simulation using the means of the input distributions was also performed. The deterministic run failed to reproduce the summer outflows when most leaching occurred, and greatly underestimated pesticide leaching. In contrast, the stochastic simulations successfully predicted the hydrologic response of the field and catchment and there was a good resemblance between the simulations and measured MCPA concentrations at the field outlet. At the catchment scale, the stochastic approach underestimated the concentrations of MCPA in the stream, probably mostly due to point sources, but perhaps also because the distributions used for the input variables did not accurately reflect conditions in the catchment. Sensitivity analyses showed that the most important factors affecting MACRO modeled diffuse MCPA losses from this catchment were soil properties controlling macropore flow, precipitation following application, and organic carbon content.},

abstract = {Studies of trace metal mobilization in sediments are generally performed using sequential extraction schemes at equilibrium. In the present work, a kinetic fractionation of trace metals in sediments has been developed to assess that information. The extraction rate data have been obtained using a single extraction scheme with EDTA and following a protocol previously optimized. Two kinetic equations and two kinetic models were used to fit the experimental data. The two constants equation fits well the extraction rate data used in this work but does not present any physico-chemical meaning. The diffusion model and the two first-order reactions model allow determining which parameter (the reaction between the metal M and the EDTA or the diffusion of the complex M/EDTA) is rate limiting in the trace metal extraction by EDTA. It appears that the two first-order reactions model is more efficient than the diffusion model to fit the present extraction rate data so it can be deduced that the diffusion of the complex M/EDTA is not the limiting step of the trace metal extraction by EDTA in estuarine sediments. In a second part, relationships between the fraction of metals determined with the two first-order reactions model and the sediments composition were established. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, after decades of studies and regulation efforts, it remains unknown whether to what degree and at what concentrations modern agricultural pesticides cause regional-scale species losses. We analyzed the effects of pesticides on the regional taxa richness of stream invertebrates in Europe (Germany and France) and Australia (southern Victoria). Pesticides caused statistically significant effects on both the species and family richness in both regions, with losses in taxa up to 42{\%} of the recorded taxonomic pools. Furthermore, the effects in Europe were detected at concentrations that current legislation considers environmentally protective. Thus, the current ecological risk assessment of pesticides falls short of protecting biodiversity, and new approaches linking ecology and ecotoxicology are needed.},

abstract = {Rainfall-induced peaks in pesticide concentrations can occur rapidly. Low frequency sampling may therefore largely underestimate maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes. Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387$\mu$gL-1. Samples from all of the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0.1$\mu$gL-1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013/39/EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25{\%}). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30- or 4-fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52{\%}), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Even appropriately used, pesticides can enter the surface and groundwater by several routes where photochemical degradation along with biotic processes contributes to their fate, resulting sometimes in the formation of stable transformation products (TPs). Yet, little is known about S-metolachlor (SM) transformation in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, commercial formulation of a pesticide might have different physical and biological properties compared to its pure grade. The present study assessed the biodegradability of the pure SM and its commercial product Mercantor Gold({\textregistered}) (MG) by employing two OECD biodegradation (301D, F) tests. Photolysis in water was investigated by using a Xe lamp. Subsequently the biodegradability of the photolysis mixtures was examined. The primary elimination of SM was monitored and structures of its TPs were elucidated by HPLC-UV-MS/MS. Additionally, a set of in silico prediction programs was applied for supporting analytical results and toxicity assessment of SM and TPs. S-metolachlor and Mercantor Gold({\textregistered}) were not biodegraded. HPLC-UV analysis showed higher elimination of SM in MG compared to pure SM during photolysis. A total of 10 photo-TPs of SM and MG were identified. According to MS data and in silico predictions, chemical structures were proposed for all found photo-TPs. Likewise for the parent compounds, no biodegradation has been observed for their photo-TPs. However, in the 301F test new bio-TPs have been generated from photo-TPs which were observed for the first time according to authors' best knowledge. The results suggest that the MG formulation does not affect the biodegradation process, but it influences the photolysis efficiency and potentially might result in faster formation of TPs in the environment. This study also demonstrates that photo-TPs can be further transformed into new products due to bacterial activity in the water phase. Moreover biotransformation might lead to an increased toxicity compared with the parent compound.},

We found that fractionation effects due to vaporization are small and positive for all compounds studied (??13C(vapor-liquid)???+0.2???), and that fractionation effects due to soil adsorption are also likely to be small (13C-labeled compounds cannot be resolved from unlabeled compounds by HPLC). We also evaluated use of the isotopic composition of contaminants as tracers of source and migration in the subsurface by performing a survey of the bulk isotopic composition of commercially available sources of BTEX The results indicate that a wide range of ??13C values exist (e.g., benzene, -23.87??? to -29.40???). Our work suggests that stable C-isotope analysis has great potential for qualifying, and possibly quantifying, the subsurface processes affecting contaminant concentrations.

abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of pesticides in surface waters is challenging due to the large number of potential contaminants. Most scientific studies and routine monitoring programs include only 15-40 pesticides, which leads to error-prone interpretations. In the present study, an extensive analytical screening was carried out using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, covering 86{\%} of all polar organic pesticides sold in Switzerland and applied to agricultural or urban land (in total 249 compounds), plus 134 transformation products; each of which could be quantified in the low ng/L range. Five medium-sized rivers, containing large areas of diverse crops and urban settlements within the respective catchments, were sampled between March and July 2012. More than 100 parent compounds and 40 transformation products were detected in total, between 30 and 50 parent compounds in each two-week composite sample in concentrations up to 1500 ng/L. The sum of pesticide concentrations was above 1000 ng/L in 78{\%} of samples. The chronic environmental quality standard was exceeded for 19 single substances; using a mixture toxicity approach, exceedances occurred over the whole measurement period in all rivers. With scenario calculations including only 30-40 frequently measured pesticides, the number of detected substances and the mixture toxicity would be underestimated on average by a factor of 2. Thus, selecting a subset of substances to assess the surface water quality may be sufficient, but a comprehensive screening yields substantially more confidence.},

abstract = {Abstract In order to evaluate the potential of compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) for tracking organochlorine pesticides in soil systems, sample pre-treatment methods have to be developed, which can provide recoveries sufficient for low detection limits without altering the isotope ratio of the target compounds. In this study we tested the compatibility of CSIA with user- and environmentally friendly extraction methods, including the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe procedure (QuEChERS), Ultrasonic Assisted Extraction (USE) and Focused Ultrasonic Extraction (FUSE), as well as clean-up methods, including sulfuric acid clean-up and Florisil{\textregistered} column chromatography for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), p,pʹ-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and their environmental metabolites (chlorinated benzenes, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene – DDE and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane – DDD) in soils. We optimized the extraction methods for maximum recovery and pre-concentration. At optimal conditions, all extraction methods and clean-up procedures, as well as the pre-concentration of the extract by solvent evaporation, led to insignificant changes in carbon isotope ratios of the target compounds. We modified the USE procedure to increase the volume of withdrawn organic extract, resulting in a higher pre-concentration of the target compounds by the subsequent solvent evaporation step. This Modified Ultrasonic Assisted Extraction (MUSE) was the most suitable procedure, and it was validated for the determination of carbon isotope ratios of the target compounds using two different types of soil matrices. The method could be applied to analyze carbon isotope ratios of HCHs, DDT, and their chlorinated metabolites in soil samples with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 mg/kg. The analytical uncertainty of MUSE, incorporating both accuracy and precision, was ≤0.4‰.},

@article{Marin-Benito2018,
abstract = {Conservation tillage practices mainly based on cover crops and no-tillage with accumulation of crop residues at the soil surface (mulch) modify the environmental fate of pesticides. However, only few pesticide fate models are able to consider mulch of crop residues as well as the effect of intermediate cover crops. Thus, the objective was to develop an approach to model the effects of crop residues left at the soil surface and cover crops on the fate of pesticides. This approach consisted in (1) considering the crop residues as a soil layer with specific physical, hydrodynamic and pesticide-reactivity properties close to that of a high organic content soil layer, and (2) introducing a correction factor of the potential evapotranspiration, estimated through a calibration step, to take into account the reduction of soil evaporation by the presence of a mulch. This approach was developed using MACRO as support pesticide model. To assess the model performances, we used the data from a field experiment designed in an irrigated maize monoculture under conservation tillage. Soil water content, water percolates, soil temperature and S-metolachlor herbicide concentrations in the leachate at 1 m depth were measured during two years. The approach chosen to simulate the mulch effects allowed MACRO to make acceptable predictions of the observed water percolation, soil temperature and to a less extent herbicide leaching. However, it showed a poor performance to simulate the soil water content. Results are discussed in terms of further modelling options to better assess the environmental risks of pesticides under conservation tillage. This approach remains to be tested against various soils, crops, pesticides and types of mulch.},

The focus of the study was to determine the extent of monochloroacetic acid (MCA) production. MCA was concentrated and derivatized from photolysate as the n-propyl ester using propanol and sulfuric acid and then identified as the ester using GC/MS and GC/ECD. On the basis of regression analysis, it was shown that the direct photodegradation of approximately 10 microM metolachlor followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the metolachlor concentration, and the half-life of the herbicide ( approximately 74 h) was independent of the pH of the medium. Photolysis in synthetic field water (SFW) resulted in a significant reduction of photolysis time (t(1/2) approximately 9 h). Direct photolysis experiments indicate a 5.19 +/- 0.81{\%} (n=3) conversion of metolachlor to MCA, while photolysis in synthetic field water and in a Don River water sample resulted in 29.8 +/- 4.6{\%} (n = 3) and 12.6 +/- 4.1{\%} (n = 3) conversion, respectively; MCA was shown to be hydrolytically stable over the time course of the photoreaction. The photodegradation of alachlor, butachlor and a model chloroacetanilide, 2-chloro-N-methylacetanilide, in SFW were also investigated.},

abstract = {The present study evaluated the influence of soil depth, soil moisture, and concentration on the persistence and degradation of metolachlor in soil. Greater percentages of metolachlor persisted in subsurface soils than in surface soil regardless of the soil moisture or initial herbicide concentration. Larger quantities of bound residues and extractable degradation products were found in the surface soils as a result of the increased soil sorption and biodegradation of metolachlor associated with the surface soil, which had more organic matter. Saturated soil favored the dissipation of metolachlor and the formation of soil-bound residues. Significantly greater quantities of a dechlorinated metabolite were measured in the saturated surface soil compared to the unsaturated soil. Mineralization of metolachlor to CO2 and volatilization of metolachlor or metolachlor degradates was minimal in surface and subsurface soils at both soil moistures and herbicide concentrations. Increased metolachlor concentrations did not inhibit microbial activity; however, the greater rate of application did result in the reduced percentage of applied [14C]metolachlor that was bound to surface or subsurface soil. A significant reduction in the quantity of extractable metolachlor degradates and unextractable soil-bound residues in sterile soil revealed the significance of biodegradation to the dissipation of metolachlor in soil.},

abstract = {A model is proposed that relates surface sealing (caused by rainfall) to the specific hydraulic and mechanical properties of the initially undisturbed soil as well as the physical characteristics of the rainfall applied, under given initial and boundary conditions defining the flow system. The soil disturbance resulting from the raindrop impacts is expressed in terms of an increase of the initial soil bulk density. The dynamics of seal formation at the soil surface are related to the following variables: the rainfall intensity, the second moment of the drop-size density distribution, the maximal drop diameter, the compaction limit of the given soil, and its initial shear strength, which depends upon the initial soil bulk density and water content. A non-uniform seal is considered, represented by an exponentially decreasing function of the bulk density with depth. The seal thickness is assumed to be dependent upon the rainfall rate. Its steady state value is assumed to be reached shortly after the beginning of rainfall so that it might be considered as constant during the stage of formation. A calibration procedure is presented on the basis of measured infiltration under sealing conditions. The results show that the proposed model addresses the main factors affecting soil sealing formation and is able to simulate the process of infiltration through sealing soils under saturated as well as unsaturated flow conditions},

abstract = {This paper introduces a simple two-layer soil water balance model developed to Bridge Event And Continuous Hydrological (BEACH) modelling. BEACH is a spatially distributed daily basis hydrological model formulated to predict the initial condition of soil moisture for event-based soil erosion and rainfall-runoff models. The latter models usually require the spatially distributed values of antecedent soil moisture content and other input parameters at the onset of an event. BEACH uses daily meteorological records, soil physical properties, basic crop characteristics and topographical data. The basic processes incorporated in the model are precipitation, infiltration, transpiration, evaporation, lateral flow, vertical flow and plant growth. The principal advantage of this model lies in its ability to provide timely information on the spatially distributed soil moisture content over a given area without the need for repeated field visits. The application of this model to the CATSOP experimental catchment showed that it has the capability to estimate soil moisture content with acceptable accuracy. The root mean squared error of the predicted soil moisture content for 6 monitored locations within the catchment ranged from 0.011 to 0.065 cm3 cm-3. The predicted daily discharge at the outlet of the study area agreed well with the observed data. The coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of the predicted discharge were 0.824 and 0.786, respectively. BEACH has been developed within freely available GIS and programming language, PCRaster. It is a useful teaching tool for learning about distributed water balance modelling and land use scenario analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nowack2006,
abstract = {This article presents a framework (MOTOR 3.01, MOdular description of the Turnover of Organic matteR), which describes the transformation of organic carbon and nutrients in soil. The state of each component of the organic matter in soil is described by a vector and the transformations by a matrix of terms. Actual turnover is calculated by multiplication of these matrices, state vectors and a rate vector. The resulting system is powerful because it is modular in construction and any one part of it may be altered simply and quickly without reference to the rest of the calculation system. Once the flow of an element is described, related nutrients (nitrogen in relation to carbon, for example) and their isotopic tracers are handled directly without additional programming or without repeated simulations. A great benefit of this approach is that mixtures of substrate or substrates of very different qualities (C:N, fibre content, labelled and unlabelled) can be dealt with easily by inserting another residue pool. If necessary the kinetics of decomposition of this new pool can differ from the others; the fate of its decomposition products is also easy to define. Where nutrients such as N are in short supply, the transformations are no longer a linear function of inputs. A novel two-call algorithm is described which first identifies if shortages of N occur during decomposition as a whole and then modifies decomposition iteratively until supply and demand for N are in balance. The structure of the modules is explained and an example given of the system's application to test a model of the protection of organic carbon and nitrogen in soil during turnover. Parameters derived from a published dataset for carbon turnover are adapted to follow the turnover of 15N-labelled crop residues in soil and the resultant model tested against two independent datasets.},

abstract = {Phytoremediation is the use of plants to remedy contaminated soils, sediments, and/or groundwater. Sorption and uptake are governed by physicochemical properties of the compounds, and moderately hydrophobic chemicals (logarithm octanol--water coefficients = 1.0--3.5) are most likely to be bioavailable to rooted, vascular plants. Some hydrophilic compounds, such as methyl-tert-butylether and 1,4-dioxane, may also be taken up by plants via hydrogen bonding with transpiration water. Organic chemicals that pass through membranes and are translocated to stem and leaf tissues may be converted (e.g., oxidized by cytochrome P450s), conjugated by glutathione or amino acids, and compartmentalized in plant tissues as bound residue. The relationship between metabolism of organic xenobiotics and toxicity to plant tissues is not well understood. A series of chlorinated ethenes is more toxic to hybrid poplar trees (Populus deltoides x nigra, DN-34) than are the corresponding chlorinated ethanes. Toxicity correlates best with the number of chlorine atoms in each homologous series. Transgenic plants have been engineered to rapidly detoxify and transform such xenobiotic chemicals. These could be used in phytoremediation applications if issues of cost and public acceptability are overcome.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical processes governing leachate attenuation inside a landfill leachate plume (Banisveld, the Netherlands) were revealed and quantified using the 1D reactive transport model PHREEQC-2. Biodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was simulated assuming first-order oxidation of two DOC fractions with different reactivity, and was coupled to reductive dissolution of iron oxide. The following secondary geochemical processes were required in the model to match observations: kinetic precipitation of calcite and siderite, cation exchange, proton buffering and degassing. Rate constants for DOC oxidation and carbonate mineral precipitation were determined, and other model parameters were optimized using the nonlinear optimization program PEST by means of matching hydrochemical observations closely (pH, DIC, DOC, Na, K, Ca, Mg, NH4, Fe(II), SO4, Cl, CH4, saturation index of calcite and siderite). The modelling demonstrated the relevance and impact of various secondary geochemical processes on leachate plume evolution. Concomitant precipitation of siderite masked the act of iron reduction. Cation exchange resulted in release of Fe(II) from the pristine anaerobic aquifer to the leachate. Degassing, triggered by elevated CO2 pressures caused by carbonate precipitation and proton buffering at the front of the plume, explained the observed downstream decrease in methane concentration. Simulation of the carbon isotope geochemistry independently supported the proposed reaction network. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mean hydrological and hydrochemical behaviour is analysed from observed time series on three agricultural catchments, located in different regions of France, named respectively Kervidy, Melarchez and Mercube. The time series are considered as input data or output data. The input data for hydrology and chemistry are respectively rainfall and nitrate leaching, and the output data are represented by stream discharge and nitrate concentration in the stream. The method is based on the spectral analysis of the data. First the spectral density function of each time series is calculated. It appears that nitrate concentrations measured at the outlet of the three catchments exhibit a strong and unique one year periodicity. This periodicity is due to the hydrological regime and the time distribution of the nitrate availability in the soil. Second, we performed a cross-spectral analysis between the input and output data. The catchment is then viewed as a linear and stationary system that converts an input to an output through a transfer function. The transfer function characterizes the behaviour of the catchment and is related to the real physical and chemical processes. For each catchment, the observed transfer functions for water and nitrate are determined in the spectral domain from the data. By comparing the observed frequency transfer function with the spectral signature of the theoretical model, we identify for each catchment: (i) the major processes that govern water and nitrate transfer and (ii) the characteristic time scale of these processes. The spectral and cross-spectral method appear to be valuable in identifying the main transfer processes operating in the different catchments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Iron (III) plaque forms on the roots of wetland plants from the reaction of Fe(II) with O2 released by roots. Recent laboratory studies have shown that Fe plaque is more rapidly reduced than non-rhizosphere Fe(III) oxides. The goals of the current study were to determine in situ rates of: (i) Fe(III) reduction of root plaque and soil Fe(III) oxides, (ii) root Fe(III) deposition, and (iii) root and soil organic matter decomposition. Iron (III) reduction was investigated using a novel buried-bag technique in which roots and soil were buried in heat-sealed membrane bags (Versapor 200 membrane, pore size = 0.2 $\mu$m) in late fall following plant senescence. Bags were retrieved at monthly intervals for 1 yr to assess changes in total C and Fe mass, Fe mineralogy, Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio, and the abundances of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). The soil C and Fe pools did not change significantly throughout the year, but root C and total root Fe mass decreased by 40 and 70{\%}, respectively. When total Fe losses were adjusted for changes in the ratio of Fe(II)/Fe(III), over 95{\%} of the Fe(III) in the plaque was reduced during the 12-mo study, at a peak rate of 0.6 mg Fe(III) g dry weight-1 d-1 (gdw-1 d-1). These estimates exceed the crude estimate of Fe(III) accumulation [0.3 mg Fe(III) g dry weight-1 d-1] on bare-root plants that were transplanted into the wetland for a growing season. We concluded that root plaque has the potential to be reduced as rapidly as it is deposited under field conditions. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract = {The frequent, widespread use of pesticides in agriculture adversely affects biodiversity, human health, and water quality. In 2008, the French government adopted an environmental policy plan, “Ecophyto 2018”, to halve pesticide use within 10 years. Trends in synthetic pesticide sales and use in France were described, through three different indicators: the number of unit doses (NUD), the quantity of active ingredient (QAI), and the treatment frequency index (TFI). Changes in pesticide use on seven of the principal arable crops in France since the implementation of this policy plan were analyzed, together with the impact of changes in pesticide use on water quality. No evidence was found for a decrease in pesticide sales at national level between 2008 and 2013. In terms of the TFI values for individual crops, the only decrease in pesticide use observed since 2001 was for soft wheat. This decrease was very slight, and pesticide use did not decline more rapidly after 2006 than before. Changes in pesticide use differed between French regions and crops. Water pollution did not decrease during the period studied. Possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the French environmental plan are considered in the context of European legislation.},

abstract = {Pesticide dissipation in wetland systems with regard to hydrological conditions and operational modes is poorly known. Here, we investigated in artificial wetlands the impact of batch versus continuous-flow modes on the dissipation of the chiral herbicide S-metolachlor (S-MET) and hydrological tracers (bromide, uranine and sulforhodamine B). The wetlands received water contaminated with the commercial formulation Mercantor Gold{\textregistered} (960 g L-1 of S-MET, 87{\%} of the S-enantiomer). The tracer mass budget revealed that plant uptake, sorption, photo- and presumably biodegradation were prominent under batch mode (i.e. characterized by alternating oxic-anoxic conditions), in agreement with large dissipation of S-MET (90{\%}) under batch mode. Degradation was the main dissipation pathway of S-MET in the wetlands. The degradate metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOXA) mainly formed under batch mode, whereas metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) prevailed under continuous-flow mode, suggesting distinct degradation pathways in each wetland. R-enantiomer was preferentially degraded under batch mode, which indicated enantioselective biodegradation. The release of MESA and MOXA by the wetlands as well as the potential persistence of S-MET compared to R-MET under both oxic and anoxic conditions may be relevant for groundwater and ecotoxicological risk assessment. This study shows the effect of batch versus continuous modes on pollutant dissipation in wetlands, and that alternate biogeochemical conditions under batch mode enhance S-MET biodegradation.},

abstract = {The effective depth of transfer (EDT) between surface soil and runoff was determined by varying the physical properties of the soil, rain intensities (RIs), slope gradients, initial water contents, and soil amendment. The effects of these factors on the EDT were quantified with simulated rain. The EDT increased (0.12-1.09cm) with an increase of RI and slope gradient (0-30°), and the effect of RI was attributed to increases in raindrop impact and runoff energy, which enhanced mixing in the surface soil. Slope gradient accelerated the velocity of water flow and decreased the stabilities of soil particles. The EDT increased from 0.192cm to 0.709cm with an increase in the initial water content, because variation in initial water content influenced soil infiltrability and detachability. The EDT exponentially decreased from 0.99 to 0.44cm and from 0.86 to 0.36cm for increasing amounts of dry granular and dissolved polyacrylamide (PAM), respectively, applied to the soil, likely because PAM improved the soil structure and prevented the formation of a crust. With soil-particle constitution ranging from silty clay to sandy loam, soil infiltration rate increased, and the EDT exponentially decreased with parameters K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. We obtained an equation describing the combined effects of the various factors on the EDT by regression analysis. Analyses of root mean square errors and the coefficients of multiple determination indicated that calculated values fit the experimental data very well. This relationship provided a method of estimating the EDT and improved the prediction of the transport of adsorbed chemicals in solution, because current models of chemical transport use fixed values.},

abstract = {Soil hydraulic properties are necessary for many studies of water and solute transport but often cannot be measured because of practical and/or financial constraints. We describe a computer program, rosetta, which implements five hierarchical pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for the estimation of water retention, and the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The hierarchy in PTFs allows the estimation of van Genuchten water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity using limited (textural classes only) to more extended (texture, bulk density, and one or two water retention points) input data. rosetta is based on neural network analyses combined with the bootstrap method, thus allowing the program to provide uncertainty estimates of the predicted hydraulic parameters. The general performance of rosetta was characterized with coefficients of determination, and root mean square errors (RMSEs). The RMSE values decreased from 0.078 to 0.044 cm3 cm−3 for water retention when more predictors were used. The RMSE for the saturated conductivity similarly decreased from 0.739 to 0.647 (dimensionless log10 units). The RMSE values for unsaturated conductivity ranged between 0.79 and 1.06, depending on whether measured or estimated retention parameters were used as predictors. Calculated mean errors showed that the PTFs underestimated water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at relatively high suctions. rosetta's uncertainty estimates can be used as an indication of model reliability when no hydraulic data are available. The rosetta program comes with a graphical user interface that allows user-friendly access to the PTFs, and can be downloaded from the US Salinity Laboratory website: http://www.ussl.ars.usda.gov/.},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) serves as a tool for source apportionment (SA) and for the quantification of the extent of degradation (QED) of organic pollutants. However, simultaneous occurrence of mixing of sources and degradation is generally believed to hamper both SA and QED. Based on the linear stable isotope mixing model and the Rayleigh equation, we developed the stable isotope sources and sinks (SISS) model that allows for simultaneous SA and QED of a pollutant that is emitted by two sources and degrades via one transformation process. It was shown that the model necessitates at least dual-element CSIA for unequivocal SA in the presence of degradation-induced isotope fractionation as illustrated for perchlorate in groundwater. The model also enables QED provided degradation follows instantaneous mixing of two sources. If mixing occurs after two sources have degraded separately, the model can still provide a conservative estimate of the overall extent of degradation. The model can be extended to a larger number of sources and sinks as outlined. It may aid in forensics and natural attenuation assessment of soil, groundwater, surface water, or atmospheric pollution.},

abstract = {The loss of fertile soil from agricultural areas in Norway is especially harmful because of the thin layer of nutrient rich soil and the limited space where agriculture is possible. Physically based soil erosion prediction models have proved to be good tools to simulate and quantify soil erosion, but are not well established in Norway yet. Due to that this study was undertaken to further improve the knowledge about soil erosion development on agricultural areas and to better establish physically based models as an additional tool for soil research, in Norway. Two models were chosen for this study: the Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) and the EROSION 3D model. These two models were applied to the Skuterud catchment in the ??s municipality, for which measured discharge data, at the outlet, was available. The goal of this study was to investigate how the differences of two physically based models will influence the result of one and the same problem, to give an in-depth insight of what are the sources of uncertainty in modelling processes. To do that both models were calibrated by comparing the simulated hydrograph with the measured data. Special attention was given to the dependency of the model results on effects of grid cell size and time resolution. The grid cell size of the maps was easily adapted by using digital elevation models (DEM) obtained from airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. Furthermore the predicted erosion patterns were compared with an orthographic picture to validate the simulation results also in a spatial context.With both models, it was possible to simulate a satisfactory accurate hydrograph and total amount of surface discharge. However, the output maps produced by the models showed quite different erosion and deposition features. ?? 2014 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIERCOMPANY.

abstract = {Pesticides impact soil microorganisms in various ways. Despite the pivotal role of the latter in ecosystem functioning, the assessment of pesticides soil microbial toxicity is lagging behind the recent methodological advances in microbial ecology. We investigated the impact of nicosulfuron, a low dose sulfonylurea herbicide, on the structure, abundance and function of the soil microbial community using standardized methodologies (PLFAs, taxa-specific qPCR and enzyme activities). For this purpose a Tiered approach involving assessment i) at extreme, long term (five repeated application cycles) exposure schemes in a microcosm experiment conducted under greenhouse conditions (x0, x10, x100 and x1000 the recommended dose, Tier I) and ii) at realistic field exposure scenarios (x0, x1, x2 and x5, Tier II) was followed. Significant reductions in the abundance of Gram negative (??-proteobacteria, planctomycetes) and Gram positive bacteria (actinobacteria) were indicated by both PLFA and qPCR analyses at low soil concentrations of nicosulfuron (0.25-1??gg-1), while a reduction of fungi at equally low levels of nicosulfuron in soil was found only by qPCR analysis. C- and P-cycling enzymes were particularly sensitive even at low soil concentration of the herbicide (0-1??gg-1). In contrast, no inhibitory effects of nicosufluron at field conditions were found. The only exception was cellobiohydrolase which were impaired at herbicide rates higher than the recommended. We suggest that the use of a tiered microcosm-to-field experimentation combined with the application of standardized methodologies could provide a comprehensive assessment of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the influence of biological growth on flow and transport patterns in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands, bromide tracer experiments were conducted in two 3 m long tanks. The tanks were filled with light weight aggregates and shell sand, respectively. The hydraulic conductivity, drainable porosity and dispersivity of the two filter media were determined before and after biological growth. The obtained breakthrough curves of bromide tracer showed that biological growth caused a pronounced reduction in drainable porosity, mainly for shell sand, whereas its effect on saturated hydraulic conductivity was negligible. The spatial distribution of the bromide after biological growth in the two filter media showed that the flow occurred preferentially along certain paths. However, in the light-weight aggregates filter medium, biological growth with possible clogging effects seems to reduce the efficiency of some preferential flow paths, increase the retention time, and hence, improves the system treatment efficiency. This study showed that selecting a filter medium including coarse fractions to some extent can mitigate the potential negative effects of bioclogging. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

All the detected metabolites account about 20{\%} of the mother compounds. There is no noticeable metabolites accumulation in the control system (no plants and no substrate), which indicate no microbial degradation taken place. Plant accumulation and soil adsorption are negligible for the removal of the four herbicides, which are {\textless} 0.6{\%}.

abstract = {The model developed in this study simulates the contamination of overland flow by soil chemicals that reside near its surface during a surface runoff event. The model includes mass-balance equations for both water flow and chemical transport in the soil profile and surface runoff. A rate-limited mass transfer through an overland-flow boundary layer at the soil overland flow interface controls the dissolved chemical transfer from soil solution to overland flow, once formed. The model predicts water flow and chemical transport in the soil profile prior to the rainfall ponding (when overland flow starts) and during the surface runoff event. The predictions of these variables, together with the total load to the surface runoff, were successfully compared with the measured data of Hubbard et al. [Trans. ASAE, 32(4) (1989) 1239]. Being physically based, the model was used to investigate the dependence of surface runoff pollution and its extent on the system hydrological parameters. A key factor on the availability of soil chemicals to pollute the overland flow is their displacement by infiltrating water prior to runoff initiation. Being dependent on soil moisture prior to rainfall initiation and on rainfall intensity, a lower chemical concentration and a lower load in surface runoff are obtained for longer ponding times, ones that are associated with lower rainfall rates and initially drier soil profiles. During the surface runoff flow, the chemical concentration in overland flow at the slope outlet is affected by the contact time of an overland flow parcel with the soil surface. Thus, it increases for higher values of equilibrium time - tE, lower rainfall rates, slope gradients, and higher soil-surface roughness coefficients. These parameters have an inverse effect on the surface runoff concentration by affecting the transfer coefficient of soil chemical to overland flow. A different insight into the relationship between the relevant dynamic processes throughout the storm event is achieved by studying the transient variation of soil chemical flux to overland flow, the chemical flux at the slope outlet, and the change of chemical mass in the overland flow. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Usually, non-equilibrium sorption is described with a two-site equilibrium/non-equilibrium model in which the non-equilibrium sorption is described with two parameters (i.e. the desorption rate coefficient of the non-equilibrium site and the Freundlich sorption coefficient of this site). Estimates of these parameters can be obtained with inverse modelling techniques. At the moment, there is little understanding about whether the confidence intervals provided by inverse modelling can be used as measure of the likely accuracy (i.e. how close the estimated value is to the true value) of these estimates. We set up a semi-global inverse modelling exercise for a large number of parameter sets (i.e. different pesticides) using simulated datasets. Inverse modelling of non-equilibrium parameters demonstrated decreasing accuracy of the estimates for decreasing values of the non-equilibrium sorption parameters and the equilibrium sorption coefficient. Furthermore, we found a relationship between the accuracy of a parameter estimate and its CV (coefficient of variation) provided by the inverse modelling technique. Using this relationship we calculated the likelihood of rightly or wrongly accepting or rejecting a parameter estimate as a function of this CV. We recommend to use this likelihood as the basis of communication with decision makers on how to decide on accepting or rejecting parameter estimates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {— Understanding hydrologic systems at the scale of large watersheds and river basins is critically important to society when faced with extreme events, such as floods and droughts, or with concerns about water quality. A critical requirement of watershed modeling is model calibration, in which the computational model's parameters are varied during a search algorithm in order to find the best match against physically-observed phenomena such as streamflow. Because it is generally performed on a laptop computer, this calibration phase can be very time-consuming, significantly limiting the ability of a hydrologist to experiment with different models. In this paper, we describe our system for watershed model calibration using cloud computing, specifically Microsoft Windows Azure. With a representative watershed model whose calibration takes 11.4 hours on a commodity laptop, our cloud-based system calibrates the watershed model in 43.32 minutes using 16 cloud cores (15.78x speedup), 11.76 minutes using 64 cloud cores (58.13x speedup), and 5.03 minutes using 256 cloud cores (135.89x speedup). We believe that such speed-ups offer the potential toward real-time interactive model creation with continuous calibration, ushering in a new paradigm for watershed modeling.},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) is a promising tool for monitoring in situ microbial activity, and enrichment factors ($\epsilon$ values) determined using CSIA can be employed to estimate compound transformation. Although $\epsilon$ values for some dechlorination reactions catalyzed by Dehalococcoides (Dhc) have been reported, reproducibility between independent experiments, variability between different Dhc strains, and congruency between pure and mixed cultures are unknown. In experiments conducted with pure cultures of Dhc sp. strain BAV1, $\epsilon$ values for 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, trans-DCE, and VC were -5.1, -14.9, -20.8, and -23.2‰, respectively. The $\epsilon$ value for 1,1-DCE dechlorination was 48.9{\%} higher than the value reported in a previous study, but $\epsilon$ values for other chlorinated ethenes were equal between independent experiments. For the dechlorination of cis-DCE and VC by Dhc strains BAV1, FL2, GT, and VS, average $\epsilon$ values were -18.4 and -23.2‰, respectively. cis-DCE and VC $\epsilon$ values determined in pure Dhc cultures with different reductive dehalogenase genes (e.g., vcrA vs bvcA) varied by less than 36.8 and 8.3{\%}, respectively. In the BDI consortium, $\epsilon$ values for cis-DCE and VC dechlorination were -25.3‰ and -19.9‰, 31.6{\%} higher and 15.3{\%} lower, respectively, compared to the average $\epsilon$ value for Dhc pure cultures. As cis-DCE and VC $\epsilon$ values are all within the same order-of-magnitude and fractionation is always measured during Dhc dechlorination, CSIA may be a valuable approach for monitoring in situ cis-DCE and VC reductive dechlorination.},

N-didesmethylvenlafaxine and tridesmethylvenlafaxine was studied in three processes: (i) anaerobic and aerobic laboratory scale tests; (ii) six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operating under different conditions; and (iii) a variety of wastewater treatments including conventional activated sludge, natural attenuation along a receiving river stream and storage in operational and seasonal reservoirs. In the laboratory and field studies, the degradation of the venlafaxine yielded O-desmethylvenalfaxine as the dominant metabolite under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Venlafaxine was almost exclusively converted to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under anaerobic conditions, but only a fraction of the drug was transformed to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under aerobic conditions. Degradation of venlafaxine involved only small stereoisomeric selectivity. In contrast, the degradation of O-desmethylvenlafaxine yielded remarkable S to R enrichment under aerobic conditions but none under anaerobic conditions. Determination of venlafaxine and its metabolites in the WWTPs agreed well with the stereoselectivity observed in the laboratory studies. Our results suggest that the levels of the drug and its metabolites and the stereoisomeric enrichment of the metabolite and its parent drug can be used for source tracking and for discrimination between domestic and nondomestic wastewater pollution. This was indeed demonstrated in the investigations carried out at the Jerusalem WWTP. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper, the second of two parts [see Abrams and Loague, this issue], reports the field-scale application of COMPTRAN (compartmentalized solute transport model) for simulating the development of redox zones. COMPTRAN is fully developed and described in the companion paper. Redox zones, which are often delineated by the relative concentrations of dissolved oxygen, have been observed around the globe. The distribution of other redox-sensitive species is affected by redox zonation. At the U.S. Geological Survey's Cape Cod research site, an anoxic zone containing high concentrations of dissolved iron has been observed. Field data were abstracted from the Cape Cod site for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional COMPTRAN simulations reported in this paper. The purpose of the concept-development simulations was to demonstrate that the compartmentalized approach reported by Abrams et al. [1998] can be linked with a solute transport model to simulate field-scale phenomena. The results presented in this paper show that COMPTRAN successfully simulated the development of redox zones at the field scale, including trends in pH and alkalinity. Thermodynamic constraints were used to prevent lower-energy redox reactions from occurring under infeasible geochemical conditions without imposing equilibrium among all redox species. Empirical methods of reaction inhibition were not needed for the simulations conducted for this study. COMPTRAN can be extended easily to include additional compartments and reactions and is capable of handling complex velocity fields in more than one dimension.},

abstract = {Organic chemicals have been detected at trace concentrations in the freshwater environment for decades. Though the term trace pollutant indicates low concentrations normally in the nanogram or microgram per liter range, many of these pollutants can exceed an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans. Trace pollutants referred to as emerging contaminants (ECs) have recently been detected in the freshwater environment and may have adverse human health effects. Analytical techniques continue to improve; therefore, the number and frequency of detections of ECs are increasing. It is difficult for regulators to restrict use of pollutants that are a human health hazard; scientists to improve treatment techniques for higher priority pollutants; and the public to modify consumption patterns due to the vast number of ECs and the breadth of literature on the occurrence, use, and toxicity. Hence, this paper examines literature containing occurrence and toxicity data for three broad classes of trace pollutants and ECs (industrials, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)), and assesses the relevance of 71 individual compounds. The evaluation indicates that widely used industrials (BPF) and PPCPs (AHTN, HHCB, ibuprofen, and estriol) occur frequently in samples from the freshwater environment but toxicity data were not available; thus, it is important to establish their ADI. Other widely used industrials (BDE-47, BDE-99) and pesticides (benomyl, carbendazim, aldrin, endrin, ethion, malathion, biphenthrin, and cypermethrin) have established ADI values but occurrence in the freshwater environment was not well documented. The highest priority pollutants for regulation and treatment should include industrials (PFOA, PFOS and DEHP), pesticides (diazinon, methoxychlor, and dieldrin), and PPCPs (EE2, carbamazepine, ??E2, DEET, triclosan, acetaminophen, and E1) because they occur frequently in the freshwater environment and pose a human health hazard at environmental concentrations. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During the 20 years from 1992 to 2011, pesticides were found at concentrations that exceeded aquatic-life benchmarks in many rivers and streams that drain agricultural, urban, and mixed-land use watersheds. Overall, the proportions of assessed streams with one or more pesticides that exceeded an aquatic-life benchmark were very similar between the two decades for agricultural (69{\%} during 1992-2001 compared to 61{\%} during 2002-2011) and mixed-land-use streams (45{\%} compared to 46{\%}). Urban streams, in contrast, increased from 53{\%} during 1992-2011 to 90{\%} during 2002-2011, largely because of fipronil and dichlorvos. The potential for adverse effects on aquatic life is likely greater than these results indicate because potentially important pesticide compounds were not included in the assessment. Human-health benchmarks were much less frequently exceeded, and during 2002-2011, only one agricultural stream and no urban or mixed-land-use streams exceeded human-health benchmarks for any of the measured pesticides. Widespread trends in pesticide concentrations, some downward and some upward, occurred in response to shifts in use patterns primarily driven by regulatory changes and introductions of new pesticides.},

The distribution is described by using 00147 Roma, Italy mapping techniques and the analysis of the spatial distribution of the lake. An analysis of the seasonal variations also indicated the dependence of the occurrence of these com-pounds on meteorological and hydrological conditions. To identify the potential sources of these organic materials, an analysis was made of the ratio of humic and fulvic acid fractions and total DOM. It was found that areas of high DOM concentration coincided with the areas of highest HA percentage of total DOM. Further-more using the ratio of the normalised concentrations of HA, FA, and residual DOM ({\textless} 5000 g/mol) it was found that areas dominated by each are spatially distinct. This confirms the hypothesis that in these shallow lakes, photodegradation and bacterioplank-ton activity will create a residence time dependent zonation of each component of the total DOM.

abstract = {The dimensionless M(V) curves indicating the distribution of pollutant mass vs volume in stormwater discharges are used to compare pollutant discharges from different rainfall events and catchments. The M(V) curves are very variable and dispersed for each pollutant and for a series of rainfall events in a given catchment. From the analysis of 197 rainfall events in 12 separate and combined sewer systems, the following results can be extracted: - in separate sewer systems, 80{\%} of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 74{\%} of the total volume for 50{\%} of the rainfall events; - in combined sewer systems, 80{\%} of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 79{\%} of the total volume for 50{\%} of the rainfall events. The characteristics of the M(V) curves depend on the pollutant, the site, the rainfall event and the functioning of the sewer system. No general multi-regression relationships can be established to explain their shape and their variability because of the complexity of the phenomena involved and the multiplicity of influencing factors. A new definition of the first flush is derived from the analysis of the M(V) curves, allowing a non-ambiguous quantification of a phenomenon which, up to now, was presented in a principally descriptive or qualitative manner. It is assumed that there is a significant first flush if at least 80{\%} of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 30{\%} of the volume discharged during rainfall events. Previous definitions proposed by other authors are discussed with regard to the treatment of stormwater discharges. However, the concept of the first flush can not be used alone to establish a reliable methodology to design treatment facilities. Additional knowledge and information are necessary. From this point of view, the analysis of experimental M(V) curves is appropriate to base a design methodology which takes into account the intrinsic variability of the phenomena.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope fractionation during aerobic mineralization of 1, 2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) by Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 was investigated. A strong enrichment of (13)C in residual 1,2-DCA was observed, with a mean fractionation factor alpha +/- standard deviation of 0.968 +/- 0.0013 to 0.973 +/- 0.0015. In addition, a large carbon isotope fractionation between biomass and inorganic carbon occurred. A mechanistic model that links the fractionation factor alpha to the rate constants of the first catabolic enzyme was developed. Based on the model, it was concluded that the strong enrichment of (13)C in 1,2-DCA arises because the first irreversible step of the initial enzymatic transformation of 1,2-DCA consists of an S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution. S(N)2 reactions are accompanied by a large kinetic isotope effect. The substantial carbon isotope fractionation between biomass and inorganic carbon could be explained by the kinetic isotope effect associated with the initial 1,2-DCA transformation and by the metabolic pathway of 1,2-DCA degradation. Carbon isotope fractionation during 1,2-DCA mineralization leads to 1,2-DCA, inorganic carbon, and biomass with characteristic carbon isotope compositions, which may be used to trace the process in contaminated environments.},

abstract = {The description of reactive transport processes in subsurface environments requires a sound understanding of both the biogeochemical complexity of the system and the spatially resolved transport of reactive species. However, most existing reactive transport models, for example in the field of contaminant hydrology, are specialized either in the simulation of the reactive or of the flow and transport processes. In this paper, we present and test the coupling of two highly flexible codes for the simulation of reactive transport processes in the subsurface: the Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator (BRNS), which contains a solver for kinetically and thermodynamically constrained biogeochemical reactions, and GeoSys/RockFlow, a multidimensional finite element subsurface flow and transport simulator. The new model, named GeoSysBRNS, maintains the full flexibility of the original models. The coupling is handled using an operator splitting scheme, which allows the reactive solver to be compiled into a problem specific library that is accessed by the transport simulator at runtime. The accuracy of the code coupling within GeoSysBRNS is demonstrated using two benchmark problems from the literature: a laboratory experiment on organic carbon degradation in a sand column via multiple microbial degradation pathways, and a dispersive mixing controlled bioreactive transport problem in aquifers, assuming three different reaction kinetics.},

abstract = {At field sites with varying redox conditions, different redox-specific microbial degradation pathways contribute to total contaminant degradation. The identification of pathway-specific contributions to total contaminant removal is of high practical relevance, yet difficult to achieve with current methods. Current stable-isotope-fractionation-based techniques focus on the identification of dominant biodegradation pathways under constant environmental conditions. We present an approach based on dual stable isotope data to estimate the individual contributions of two redox-specific pathways. We apply this approach to carbon and hydrogen isotope data obtained from reactive transport simulations of an organic contaminant plume in a two-dimensional aquifer cross section to test the applicability of the method. To take aspects typically encountered at field sites into account, additional simulations addressed the effects of transverse mixing, diffusion-induced stable-isotope fractionation, heterogeneities in the flow field, and mixing in sampling wells on isotope-based estimates for aerobic and anaerobic pathway contributions to total contaminant biodegradation. Results confirm the general applicability of the presented estimation method which is most accurate along the plume core and less accurate towards the fringe where flow paths receive contaminant mass and associated isotope signatures from the core by transverse dispersion. The presented method complements the stable-isotope-fractionation-based analysis toolbox. At field sites with varying redox conditions, it provides a means to identify the relative importance of individual, redox-specific degradation pathways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Wetlands are reactive landscape zones that provide ecosystem services, including the improvement of water quality. Field studies distinguishing pesticide degradation from retention to evaluate the sink and source functions of wetlands are scarce. This study evaluated based on a complete mass budget the partitioning, retention, and degradation of 12 pesticides in water, suspended solids, sediments, and organisms in a wetland receiving contaminated runoff. The mass budget showed the following: (i) dissolved pesticides accounted for 95{\%} of the total load entering the wetland and the pesticide partitioning between the dissolved phase and the suspended solids varied according to the molecules, (ii) pesticides accumulated primarily in the {\textless}250 $\mu$m bed sediments during spring and late summer, and (iii) the hydrological regime or the incoming pesticide loads did not influence the pesticide dissipation, which varied according to the molecules and the wetland biogeochemical conditions. The vegetation enhanced the pesticide degradation during the vegetative phase and the pesticides were released during plant senescence. The dithiocarbamates were degraded under oxic conditions in spring, whereas glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) degradation occurred under reducing conditions during the summer. The complete pesticide mass budget indicates the versatility of the pesticide sink and source functions of wetland systems.},

abstract = {A generalized formulation for kinetically controlled reactions has been developed and incorporated into a multicomponent reactive transport model to facilitate the investigation of a large variety of problems involving inorganic and organic chemicals in variably saturated media. The general kinetic formulation includes intra-aqueous and dissolutionprecipitation reactions in addition to geochemical equilibrium expressions for hydrolysis, aqueous complexation, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and gas dissolution-exsolution reactions. The generalized approach allows consideration of fractional order terms with respect to any dissolved species in terms of species activities or in terms of total concentrations, which facilitates the incorporation of a variety of experimentally derived rate expressions. Monod and inhibition terms can be used to describe microbially mediated reactions or to limit the reaction progress of inorganic reactions. Dissolution-precipitation reactions can be described as surface-controlled or transport-controlled reactions. The formulation also facilitates the consideration of any number of parallel reaction pathways, and reactions can be treated as irreversible or reversible processes. Two groundwater contamination scenarios, both set in variably saturated media but with significantly different geochemical reaction networks, are investigated and demonstrate the advantage of the generalized approach. The first problem focuses on a hypothetical case study of the natural attenuation of organic contaminants undergoing dissolution, volatilization, and biodegradation in an unconfined aquifer overlaid by unsaturated sediments. The second problem addresses the generation of acid mine drainage in the unsaturated zone of a tailings impoundment at the Nickel Rim Mine Site near Sudbury, Ontario, and subsequent reactive transport in the saturated portion of the tailings.},

Pesticides currently used in California's Central Valley were detected in snow and rain samples from two elevations in Sequoia National Park (SNP) in the southern Sierras. At the lower elevation site (533 m), chlorothalonil was present at the highest levels ({\textless}0.4-85 ng/L), followed by malathion ({\textless}0.046-24 ng/L), diazinon ({\textless}0.21-19 ng/L), and chlorpyrifos (1.3-4.4 ng/L). At 1,920 m elevation, chlorothalonil was also present at the highest levels ({\textless}0.57-13 ng/L) followed by diazinon ({\textless}0.057-14 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (1.1-13 ng/L), and malathion ({\textless}0.045-6 ng/L). Trifluralin, alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and alpha- and beta-endosulfan were also detected at both locations and at lower concentrations, generally ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/L. In the Lake Tahoe basin, elevation -2,200 m, malathion was also found in snow at concentrations ranging from {\textless}0.046 to 18 ng/L, as was diazinon ({\textless}0.057-7 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (0.30-3.4 ng/L), and chlorothalonil (0.66-1.7 ng/L). Chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, alpha- and gamma-HCH, and alpha-endosulfan were found in surface and deep water samples at two locations in Lake Tahoe and at concentrations similar to those found in snow within the lake basin. Lake Tahoe basin snow samples in general had lower concentrations than those from SNP. This difference in concentration levels reflects the closer proximity of downwind pesticide usage to SNP than the Lake Tahoe basin. An estimated annual loading of one chemical, chlorpyrifos, of 24 to 31 kg/year was made for the SNP land area. Comparisons of observed concentrations were made with reported aquatic toxicity and water criteria levels.},

abstract = {Sulfur biogeochemical cycling and associated Fe-S mineralization processes exert a major influence over acidity dynamics, electron flow and contaminant mobility in wetlands, benthic sediments and groundwater systems. While S biogeochemical cycling has been studied intensively in many environmental settings, relatively little direct information exists on S cycling in formerly drained wetlands that have been remediated via tidal re-flooding. This study focuses on a tidal wetland that was drained in the 1970s (causing severe soil and water acidification), and subsequently remediated by controlled re-flooding in 2002. We examine SO42- reduction rates and Fe-S mineralization at the tidal fringe, 7years after the commencement of re-flooding. The initial drainage of the wetland examined here caused in-situ pyrite (FeS2) oxidation, resulting in the drained soil layers being highly acidic and rich in SO42--bearing Fe(III) minerals, including jarosite (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6). Tidal re-flooding has neutralized much of the previous acidity, with the pore-water pH now mostly spanning pH 5-7. The fastest rates of in-situ SO42- reduction (up to {\~{}}300nmolcm-3day-1) occur within the inter-tidal zone in the near-surface soil layers (to {\~{}}60cm below ground surface). The SO42- reduction rates correlate with pore-water dissolved organic C concentrations, thereby suggesting that electron donor supply was the predominant rate determining factor. Elemental S was a major short-term product of SO42- reduction, comprising up to 69{\%} of reduced inorganic S in the near-surface soil layers. This enrichment in elemental S can be partly attributed to interactions between biogenic H2S and jarosite - a process that also contributed to enrichment in pore-water Fe2+ (up to 55mM) and SO42- (up to 50mM). The iron sulfide thiospinel, greigite (Fe3S4), was abundant in near-surface soil layers within the inter- to sub-tidal zone where tidal water level fluctuations created oscillatory redox conditions. There was evidence for relatively rapid pyrite re-formation within the re-flooded soil layers. However, the results indicate that pyrite re-formation has occurred mainly in the lower formerly drained soil layers, whereas the accumulation of elemental S and greigite has been confined towards the soil surface. The discovery that pyrite formation was spatially decoupled from that of elemental S and greigite challenges the concept that greigite is an essential precursor required for sedimentary pyrite formation. In fact, the results suggest that greigite and pyrite may represent distinct end-points of divergent Fe-S mineralization pathways. Overall, this study highlights novel aspects of Fe-S mineralization within tidal wetlands that have been drained and re-flooded, in contrast to normal, undisturbed tidal wetlands. As such, the long-term biogeochemical trajectory of drained and acidified wetlands that are remediated by tidal re-flooding cannot be predicted from the well-studied behaviour of normal tidal wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has been established as a viable tool for proving, characterizing and assessing degradation of organic pollutants within contaminated aquifers. The fractionation of stable isotopes during contaminant degradation leads to observable shifts in stable isotope ratios which can serve as an indicator for in situ pollutant degradation and allow for a quantitative assessment by means of the so-called Rayleigh (distillation) equation.  This review highlights the recent developments of the Rayleigh equation approach for quantifying in situ degradation of organic pollutants in contaminated aquifers. The advantages and limitations of the Rayleigh equation approach are discussed and suggestions for improvements are given. Concepts are provided to estimate the uncertainty due to errors or variability of input parameters and how to deal with such uncertainty. Moreover, the applicability of the Rayleigh equation approach is evaluated regarding the heterogeneity and complexity of groundwater systems. For such systems, the review discusses the relevance of non-destructive processes, which affect the concentration (e.g., dispersive mixing) and potentially also the stable isotope ratio of contaminants (e.g., sorption, volatilization), and the resulting implications for the Rayleigh equation approach.},

abstract = {Urban soils polluted with heavy metals are of increasing concern because it is greatly affecting human health and the ecological systems. Hence, it is mandatory to understand the reasons behind this pollution and remediate the contaminated solid. The removal of heavy metals from contaminated soil samples collected from the vicinity of the sewage lake in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was explored. The leaching process was studied kinetically and thermodynamically for better understanding of the remediation process. The results showed that the soil samples were slightly basic in nature, and tend to be more neutral away from the main contaminated sewage lake area. The total metal content in the soil samples was measured using the aqua regia extractions by ICP-OES and the results showed that many of the heavy metals present have significant concentrations above the tolerable limits. In general, the metal concentrations at different sites indicated that the heavy metal pollution is mainly due to the sewage discharge to the lake. The results showed excellent correlation between the concentrations of Co, As, and Hg with the distance from the main contaminated area. The leaching of Co, As, and Hg using 1.0M hydrochloric acid from the soil was studied kinetically at different temperatures and the experimental results were fitted using different kinetics models. The experimental data were best described with two-constant rate and Elovich equation kinetic models. Also, the thermodynamic study showed that the leaching process was spontaneous, endothermic and accompanied with increase in the entropy. In general, the polluted soil could be remediated successfully from the heavy metals using the acid leaching procedure in a short period of time.},

abstract = {Degradation of pesticides in soils is both spatially variable and also one of the most sensitive factors determining losses to surface water and groundwater. To date, no general guidance is available on suitable approaches for dealing with spatial variation in pesticide degradation in catchment or regional scale modeling applications. The purpose of the study was therefore to study the influence of various soil physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics on pesticide persistence in the contrasting cultivated soils found in a small (13 km(2)) agricultural catchment in Sweden and to develop and test a simple model approach that could support catchment scale modeling. Persistence of bentazone, glyphosate and isoproturon was investigated in laboratory incubation experiments. Degradation rate constants were highly variable with coefficients of variation ranging between 42 and 64{\%} for the three herbicides. Multiple linear regression analysis and Mallows Cp statistic were employed to select the best set of independent parameters accounting for the variation in degradation. Soil pH and the proportion of active microorganisms (r) together explained 69{\%} of the variation in the bentazone degradation rate constant; the Freundlich sorption co-efficient (K(f)) and soil laccase activity together explained 88{\%} of the variation in degradation rate of glyphosate, while soil pH was a significant predictor (p{\textless}0.05) for isoproturon persistence. However, correlations between many potential predictor variables made clear interpretations of the statistical analysis difficult. Multiplicative models based on two predictors chosen 'a priori', one accounting for microbial activity (e.g. microbial respiration, laccase activity or the surrogate variable soil organic carbon, SOC) and one accounting for the effects of sorption on bioavailability, showed promise to support predictions of degradation for large-scale modeling applications, explaining up to 50{\%} of the variation in herbicide persistence.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotope fractionation during the reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes by two bacterial strains that dechlorinate to ethene, Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 and Dehalococcoides sp. strain BAV1 as well as Sulfurospirillum multivorans and Dehalobacter restrictus strain PER-K23, isolates that do not dechlorinate past DCE, are reported. Fractionation by a Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment culture is also measured for comparison to the isolates. All data adequately fit the Rayleigh model and results are presented as enrichment factors. For strain 195, the measured enrichment factors were -9.6 +/- 0.4, -21.1 +/- 1.8, and -5.8 +/- 0.5 when degrading TCE, cDCE, and 1,1-DCE, respectively. Strain BAV1 exhibited enrichment factors of -16.9 +/- 1.4, -8.4 +/- 0.3, -21.4 +/- 0.9, and -24.0 +/- 2.0 for cDCE, 1,1-DCE, tDCE, and VC, respectively. The surprisingly large differences in enrichment factors caused by individual reductases (RDases) reducing different chloroethenes is likely the result of chemical structure differences among the chloroethenes. For TCE reduction, S. multivorans and D. restrictus strain PER-K23 exhibited enrichment factors of -16.4 +/- 1.5 and -3.3 +/- 0.3, respectively. While all of the organisms studied here utilize RDases that require corrinoid cofactors, the biotic TCE enrichment factors varied widely from those reported for the abiotic cobalamin-catalyzed reaction, indicating that additional factors affect the extent of fractionation in these biological systems. The enrichment factors measured for the Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment culture did not match well with those from any of the isolates, demonstrating the inherent difficulties in predicting fractionation factors of undefined communities. Although compound-specific isotope fractionation is a powerful tool for evaluating the progress of in situ bioremediation in the field, given the wide range of enrichment factors associated with functionally similar and phylogenetically diverse organisms, caution must be exercised when applying enrichment factors for the interpretation of dechlorination data.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is recognized as a powerful tool for monitoring, assessing, and validating in-situ bioremediation processes. In this study, kinetic carbon isotope fractionation factors ($\epsilon$) associated with the aerobic biodegradation of vinyl chloride (VC), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cDCE), and trichloroethylene (TCE) were examined. Of the three solvents, the largest fractionation effects were observed for biodegradation of VC. Both metabolic and cometabolic VC degradation were studied using Mycobacterium aurum L1 (grown on VC), Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (grown on methane), Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5 (grown on propane), and two VC enrichment cultures seeded from contaminated soils of Alameda Point and Travis Air Force Base, CA. M. aurum L1 caused the greatest fractionation ($\epsilon$ = ?5.7) while for the cometabolic cultures, $\epsilon$ values ranged from ?3.2 to ?4.8. VC fractionation patterns for the enrichment cultures were within the range of those observed for the metabolic and cometabolic cultures ($\epsilon$ = ?4.5 to ?5.5). The fractionation for cometabolic degradation of TCE by Me. trichosporium OB3b was low ($\epsilon$ = ?1.1), while no quantifiable carbon isotopic fractionation was observed during the cometabolic degradation of cDCE. For all three of the tested chlorinated ethenes, isotopic fractionation measured during aerobic degradation was significantly smaller than that reported for anaerobic reductive dechlorination. This study suggests that analysis of compound-specific isotopic fractionation could assist in determining whether aerobic or anaerobic degradation of VC and cDCE predominates in field applications of in-situ bioremediation. In contrast, isotopic fractionation effects associated with metabolic and cometabolic reactions are not sufficiently dissimilar to distinguish these processes in the field.},

abstract = {Trichloroethylene (TCE) is an industrial solvent and a widespread environmental contaminant. Induction of liver cancer in mice by TCE is thought to be mediated by two metabolites, dichloroacetate (DCA) and trichloroacetate (TCA), both of which are themselves mouse liver carcinogens. TCE, TCA, and DCA are relatively weak peroxisome proliferators (PP), a group of rodent hepatocarcinogens that activate a nuclear receptor, PP-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha. The objective of this review is to assess the weight of evidence (WOE) that PPARalpha is or is not mechanistically involved in mouse liver tumor induction by TCE and metabolites. Based on similarities of TCE and TCA to typical PP, including dose-response characteristics showing PPARalpha-dependent responses coincident with liver tumor induction and abolishment of TCE and TCA effects in PPARalpha-null mice, the WOE supports the hypothesis that PPARalpha plays a dominant role in TCE- and TCA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Data indicates that the MOA for DCA tumor induction is PPARalpha-independent. Uncertainties remain regarding the genesis of the TCE-induced tumors. In contrast to the TCA-induced tumors, which have molecular features similar to those induced by typical PP, there is evidence, albeit weak, that TCE tumors arise by a mode of action (MOA) different from that of TCA tumors, based largely on dissimilarities in molecular markers found in TCE versus TCA-induced tumors. In summary, the WOE indicates that TCA-induced liver tumors arise by a PPARalpha-dependent MOA. Although the TCE MOA is likely dominated by a PPARalpha-dependent contribution from TCA, the contribution of a PPARalpha-independent MOA from DCA cannot be ruled out.},

In laboratory batch model systems, we determined the C, H, and N isotope enrichment factors for the oxidation by MnO(2) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), derived apparent (13)C-, (2)H-, and (15)N-kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs), and characterized reaction products. The N-atom oxidation pathway leading to radical coupling products typically exhibited inverse (15)N-AKIEs (up to 0.991) and only minor (13)C- and (2)H-AKIEs. Oxidative N-dealkylation, in contrast, was subject to large normal (13)C- and (2)H-AKIEs (up to 1.019 and 3.1, respectively) and small (15)N-AKIEs. Subtle changes of the compound's electronic properties due to different types of aromatic and/or N-alkyl substituents resulted in changes of reaction mechanisms, rate-limiting step(s), and thus isotope fractionation trends. The complex sequence of electron and proton transfers during the oxidative transformation of substituted aromatic N-alkyl amines suggests highly compound- and mechanism-dependent isotope effects precluding extrapolations to other organic micropollutants reacting along the same degradation pathways.},

The spatial patterns of radial oxygen loss (ROL), determined with root-sleeving oxygen electrodes, indicated a strong constitutive 'barrier' to ROL in the basal root zones of the two monocotyledonous species. In contrast, roots of the dicotyledonous species showed no significant 'barrier' to ROL when grown in aerated solution, and only a partial 'barrier' when grown in stagnant conditions. This partial 'barrier' was strongest in C. palustris, so that ROL from basal zones of roots of R. sceleratus and R. palustris was substantial when compared to the monocotyledonous species. ROL from the basal zones would decrease longitudinal diffusion of oxygen to the root apex, and therefore limit the maximum penetration depth of these roots into anaerobic soil. Further studies of a larger number of dicotyledonous wetland species from a range of substrates are required to elucidate the ecophysiological consequences of developing a partial, rather than a strong, 'barrier' to ROL.},

abstract = {Abstract A simulation model for prediction of herbicide persistence in the field is described. The model combines the effects of soil temperature and soil moisture content on the rates of herbicide loss, determined experimentally under controlled conditions, with the fluctuations in surface soil temperature and moisture content in the field. The computer program includes methods of simulating surface soil temperatures and moisture contents from standard meteorological data. In order to test the model, the degradation of napropamide (2-(a-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethylpropionamide) was examined. Under controlled conditions, loss of activity followed first-order kinetics with half-lives of 54, 63, and 90 days at 28C with soil moisture contents of 10.0, 7.5, and 3.5{\%}, respectively. At 14C, half-lives at 10.0 and 7.5{\%} soil moisture were 102 and 112 days, respectively. When these data were used in the simulation model in conjunction with the relevant meteorological information, the patterns of loss of napropamide incorporated 2 to 3 cm in the field could be predicted. Napropamide was lost rapidly when applied to the soil surface, and since the model only takes into account losses through microbial or chemical metabolism, this could not be simulated. Some of the limitations and the potential benefit of the simulation technique for prediction of pesticide persistence are discussed.},

Fifty bacterial isolates were retrieved from the CW, related phylogenetically to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, ??-, ??-, and ??-Proteobacteria. Changes in the bacterial communities, from roots and substrate of each series, related to the plant species, hydraulic loading rates and along CW operation were examined using denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).

abstract = {$\alpha$-Hexachlorocyclohexane ($\alpha$-HCH) is the only chiral isomer of the eight 1,2,3,4,5,6-HCHs and we have developed an enantiomer-specific stable carbon isotope analysis (ESIA) method for the evaluation of its fate in the environment. The carbon isotope ratios of the $\alpha$-HCH enantiomers were determined for a commercially available $\alpha$-HCH sample using a gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) system equipped with a chiral column. The GC-C-IRMS measurements revealed $\delta$-values of -32.5 ± 0.8‰ and -32.3 ± 0.5‰ for (-) $\alpha$-HCH and (+) $\alpha$-HCH, respectively. The isotope ratio of bulk $\alpha$-HCH was estimated to be -32.4 ± 0.6‰ which was in accordance with the $\delta$-values obtained by GC-C-IRMS (-32.7 ± 0.2‰) and elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) of the bulk $\alpha$-HCH (-32.1 ± 0.1‰). The similarity of the isotope ratio measurements of bulk $\alpha$-HCH by EA-IRMS and GC-C-IRMS indicates the accuracy of the chiral GC-C-IRMS method. The linearity of the $\alpha$-HCH ESIA method shows that carbon isotope ratios can be obtained for a signal size above 100 mV. The ESIA measurements exhibited standard deviations (2$\sigma$) that were mostly {\textless} ± 0.5‰. In order to test the chiral GC-C-IRMS method, the isotope compositions of individual enantiomers in biodegradation experiments of $\alpha$-HCH with Clostridium pasteurianum and samples from a contaminated field site were determined. The isotopic compositions of the $\alpha$-HCH enantiomers show a range of enantiomeric and isotope patterns, suggesting that enantiomeric and isotope fractionation can serve as an indicator for biodegradation and source characterization of $\alpha$-HCH in the environment.},

The simple variations in lithology and infiltration combine into a complex groundwater chemistry, showing ongoing Fe-oxide reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Rates of sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and methane oxidation were measured directly using radiotracers. Maximum rates were 1.5 mM/yr for sulfate reduction, 0.3 mM/yr for methanogenesis, and only 4.5 ??M/yr for methane oxidation. The overlap of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis was very small. The important intermediates formed during the degradation of the organic matter in the sediment, formate and acetate, had concentrations around 2 ??M in the sulfate reducing zone, increasing to 10 and 25 ??M in the methanogenic part. The concentration of H2 was around 0.25 nM in the Fe-reducing zone, 0.4 nM in the sulfate reducing zone, and increased to 6 nM in the methanogenic zone. Using in situ concentrations of products and reactants the available energies for a range of different reactions could be calculated. The results of the calculations are in accordance with the observed distribution of the ongoing redox processes, implying that the system is well described using a partial equilibrium approach. A 2D numerical PHAST model of the system based on the partial equilibrium approach, extended by implementing specific energy yields for the microbial redox processes, could explain most of the observed groundwater geochemistry as an expression of a closely coupled system of mineral equilibria and redox processes occurring at partial equilibrium. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the use of two rainfall simulators designed to rain on 2-m-long (2-m2) and 10.7-m-long (32.6-m2) plots to estimate overland flow and phosphorus (P) transport in comparison with watershed-scale data. Simulated rainfall (75 mm h(-1)) generated more overland flow from 2-m-long (20 L m2) than from 10.7-m-long (10 L m2) plots established in grass, no-till corn (Zea mays L.), and recently tilled fields, because a relatively greater area of the smaller plots became saturated ({\textgreater}75{\%} of area) during rainfall compared with large plots ({\textless}75{\%} area). Although average concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in overland flow were greater from 2-m-long (0.50 mg L(-1)) than 10.7-m-long (0.35 mg L(-1)) plots, the relationship between DRP and Mehlich-3 soil P (as defined by regression slope) was similar for both plots and for published watershed data (0.0022 for grassed, 0.0036 for no-till, and 0.0112 for tilled sites). Conversely, sediment, particulate phosphorus (PP), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and selective transport of soil fines ({\textless}2 microm) were significantly lower from 2- than 10.7-m-long plots. However, slopes of the logarithmic regression between P enrichment ratio and sediment discharge were similar (0.281-0.301) for 2- and 10.7-m-long plots, and published watershed data. While concentrations and loads of P change with plot scales, processes governing DRP and PP transport in overland flow are consistent, supporting the limited use of small plots and rainfall simulators to assess the relationship between soil P and overland flow P as a function of soil type and management.},

abstract = {Various studies over the last 15 years have attempted to describe the processes of N retention, saturation and NO3 − leaching in semi-natural ecosystems based on stable isotope studies. Forest ecologists and terrestrial biogeochemists have used 15N labelled NO3 − and NH4 + tracers to determine the fate of atmospheric deposition inputs of N to terrestrial ecosystems, with NO3 − leaching to surface waters being a key output flux. Separate studies by aquatic ecologists have used similar isotope tracer methods to determine the fate and impacts of inorganic N species, leached from terrestrial ecosystems, on aquatic ecosystems, usually without reference to comparable terrestrial studies. A third group of isotopic studies has employed natural abundances of 15N and 18O in precipitation and surface water NO3 − to determine the relative contributions of atmospheric and microbial sources. These three sets of results often appear to conflict with one another. Here we attempt to synthesize and reconcile the results of these differing approaches to identifying both the source and the fate of inorganic N in natural or semi-natural ecosystems, and identify future research priorities. We conclude that the results of different studies conform to a consistent conceptual model comprising: (1) rapid microbial turnover of atmospherically deposited NO3 − at multiple biologically active locations within both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (2) maximum retention and accumulation of N in carbon-rich ecosystems and (3) maximum leaching of NO3 −, most of which has been microbially cycled, from carbon-poor ecosystems exposed to elevated atmospheric N inputs.},

abstract = {The assessment of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers has become an issue of increasing importance in the recent years. To some extent, this can be related to the acceptance of intrinsic bioremediation or monitored natural attenuation as a means to manage contaminated sites. Among the few existing methods to detect biodegradation in the subsurface, stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) is one of the most promising approaches which is pronounced by the drastically increasing number of applications. This review covers the recent laboratory and field studies assessing biodegradation of contaminants via stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope enrichment factors have been found that vary from no fractionation for dioxygenase reactions converting aromatic hydrocarbons over moderate fractionation by monooxygenase reactions (??=-3???) and some anaerobic studies on microbial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (??=-1.7???) to larger fractionations by anaerobic dehalogenation reactions of chlorinated solvents (??=between -5??? and -30???). The different isotope enrichment factors can be related to the respective biochemical reactions. Based on that knowledge, we discuss under what circumstances SIFA can be used for a qualitative or even a quantitative assessment of biodegradation in the environment. In a steadily increasing number of cases, it was possible to explain biodegradation processes in the field based on isotope enrichment factors obtained from laboratory experiments with pure cultures and measured isotope values from the field. The review will focus on the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents as the major contaminants of groundwater. Advances in the instrumental development for stable isotope analysis are only mentioned if it is important for the understanding of the application. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Chiral pesticides are important contaminants affecting the health and functioning of aquatic systems. The combination of stable isotope and enantiomer analysis techniques has been recently proposed to better characterize the fate of these contaminants in natural and engineered settings. We introduce a modeling approach with the aim of unifying and integrating the interpretation of isotopic and enantiomeric fractionation. The model is based on the definition of enantiomer-specific isotopologues and jointly predicts the evolution of concentration, enantiomer fractionation, as well as changes in stable isotope ratios of different elements. The method allows evaluating different transformation pathways and was applied to investigate enzymatic degradation of dichlorprop (DCPP), enzymatic degradation of mecoprop methyl ester (MCPPM), and microbial degradation of $\alpha$-hexachlorocyclohexane ($\alpha$-HCH) by different bacterial strains and under different redox conditions. The model accurately reproduces the isotopic and enantiomeric data observed in previous experimental studies and precisely captures the dual-dimensional trends characterizing different reaction pathways. Furthermore, the model allows testing possible combinations of enantiomer analysis (EA), compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA), and enantiomer specific isotope analysis (ESIA) to identify and assess isotope and enantiomer selective reaction mechanisms.},

The separation of metolachlor enantiomers was achieved using a LC-MS equipped with a chiral stationary phase based on cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate) and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source operated under positive ion mode. The enantiomers of ESA and OXA were separated using CZE with gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD) as chiral selector. Various CZE conditions were investigated to achieve the best resolution of the ESA and OXA enantiomers. The optimum background CZE electrolyte was found to consist of borate buffer (pH=9) containing 20{\%} methanol (v/v) and 2.5{\%} gamma-CD (w/v). Maximum resolution of ESA and OXA enantiomers was achieved using a capillary temperature of 15 degrees C and applied voltage of 30 kV. The applicability of the LC-MS and CZE methods was demonstrated successfully on the enantiomeric analysis of metolachlor and its metabolites in samples from a soil and water degradation study that was set up to probe the stereoselectivity of metolachlor biodegradation. These techniques allow the enantiomeric ratios of the target analytes to be followed over time during the degradation process and thus will prove useful in determining the role of chirality in pesticide degradation and metabolite formation.},

This review provides a summary of the recent occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment including sewage, surface water, groundwater and drinking water. The discharge of treated effluent from WWTPs is a major pathway for the introduction of micropollutants to surface water. WWTPs act as primary barriers against the spread of micropollutants. WWTP removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries/regions depicts compound-specific variation in removal, ranging from 12.5 to 100{\%}. Advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane bioreactors can achieve higher and more consistent micropollutant removal. However, regardless of what technology is employed, the removal of micropollutants depends on physico-chemical properties of micropollutants and treatment conditions. The evaluation of micropollutant removal from municipal wastewater should cover a series of aspects from sources to end uses. After the release of micropollutants, a better understanding and modeling of their fate in surface water is essential for effectively predicting their impacts on the receiving environment. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Assessment of water resources available in different storages and moving along different pathways in a catchment is important for its optimal use and protection, and also for the prediction of floods and low flows. Moreover, understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydro logical response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist, but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study, field observations of precipitation, groundwater and surface water levels and discharges, together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series, and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover, a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydro logical approaches that approximately 90{\%} of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment, and only the remaining 10{\%} is surface runoff. The impact of remote recharge causing displacement of near channel ground water during floods could also be motivated with hydraulic approximations. The results show further that when base flow separation is meant to identify groundwater contributions to stream flow, process based methods (e.g. the rating curve method; Kliner and Knezek, 1974) are more reliable than other simple non-tracer based methods. Also, the recursive filtering method (proposed by Eckhardt, 2005) can be calibrated well using the results of tracer investigation giving good results. Consequently, non-tracer based base flow separation methods that can be validated for some events may provide a powerful tool for groundwater assessment or model calibration/validation in lowland areas. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {This Guidance Document for conducting pesticides terrestrial field dissipation (TFD) studies has been developed by an ad hoc Expert Group of the OECD Working Group on Pesticides (WGP). Developing guidance for conducting terrestrial field dissipation studies is part of a global project that includes constructing an ecoregion crosswalk between North America and European ecoregions. The ecoregion crosswalk objectives are to: (i) identify similar eco-regions between North America and Europe; (ii) provide a GIS (geographic information systems)-based decision support to assist in the selection of regions for TFD studies; and (iii) provide background information on pesticide use areas (crop-based), soils and climate. The outcome of the project is the present international guidance document for conducting pesticide field dissipation studies and identifying similar ecoregions. A harmonised methodology, based on a conceptual model and modular approach, is provided to conduct the study. This will allow for pesticide field dissipation/ accumulation studies conducted at foreign sites to be evaluated and considered by other countries and regulatory agencies. In parallel to this guidance document, an ENASGIPS model – Europe-North America Soil Geographic Information for Pesticide Studies – has been developed and is available publicly (www.enasgips3.org). It is a GIS-based model for identifying similar ecoregions between Europe and North America and a tool for field site selection based on concerns identified in the conceptual model. After two rounds of comments in 2014-2015 among the WGP and the Working Group of National Co-ordinators of the Test Guidelines Programme (WNT), the TFD Guidance Document was approved by the WGP and WNT in October 2015, and declassified in February 2015.

Theoretical frameworks and models for describing the transfer process were also reviewed. The existing models were classified into four categories based on their principles: mixing-layer models, interfacial diffusion-controlled models, interfacial-diffusion and rainfall-dispersion models, and empirical models. The assumptions, parameters, applications, limitations or potential issues, and further improvements for each category of the models were discussed. It is recommended that new experimental methods be developed and current theoretical frameworks be further refined by considering the effects of other environmental factors and transport mechanisms on solute transfer from the soil surface to overland flow so that the models can be applied to a wider range of practical field conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract The solution of many field-scale flow and transport problems requires estimates of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. The objective of this study was to calibrate neural network models for prediction of water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, from basic soil properties. Twelve neural network models were developed to predict water retention parameters using a data set of 1209 samples containing sand, silt, and clay contents, bulk density, porosity, gravel content, and soil horizon as well as water retention data. A subset of 620 samples was used to develop 19 neural network models to predict Ks. Prediction of water retention parameters and Ks generally improved if more input data were used. In a more detailed investigation, four models with the following levels of input data were selected: (i) soil textural class, (ii) sand, silt, and clay contents, (iii) sand, silt, and clay contents and bulk density, and (iv) the previous variables and water content at a pressure head of 33 kPa. For water retention, the root mean square residuals decreased from 0.107 for the first to 0.060 m3 m-3 for the fourth model while the root mean square residual Ks decreased from 0.627 to 0.451 log(cm d-1). The neural network models performed better on our data set than four published pedotransfer functions for water retention (by ≈0.01–0.05 m3 m-3) and better than six published functions for Ks (by ≈0.1–0.9 order of magnitude). Use of the developed hierarchical neural network models is attractive because of improved accuracy and because it permits a considerable degree of flexibility toward available input data.},

The agricultural soils used are characterized by (i) large variations in soil texture (sand content 4-88{\%}) and organic matter content (0.97-2.70{\%} org. C), (ii) fairly diverse soil-water retention curves, and (iii) differing pH values. We quantified the effect of soil moisture on mineralization of pesticides and found that (i) at soil water potential {\textless} or = -20 MPa minimal pesticide mineralization occurred; (ii) a linear correlation (P {\textless} 0.0001) exists between increasing soil moisture (within a soil water potential range of -20 and -0.015 MPa), and increased relative pesticide mineralization; (iii) optimum pesticide mineralization was obtained at a soil water potential of -0.015 MPa, and (iv) when soil moisture approximated water holding capacity, pesticide mineralization was considerably reduced. As both selected pesticides and soils varied to a large degree, we propose that the correlation observed in this study may be also valid in the case of aerobic degradation of other native and artificial organic compounds in soils.},

abstract = {Cometabolism recognizes that microorganisms can transform non-growth-supporting substrates. The term "cometabolism" was first introduced over 30 years ago and has been redefined, criticized, and used widely ever since. In this review we have examined the aerobic cometabolism of chlorinated solvents, with a particular emphasis on the cometabolism of trichloroethylene. Monooxygenases or dioxygenases with relaxed substrate ranges initiate these transformations. The physiological role of the oxygenases is to initiate the metabolism of growth-supporting substrates (e.g., methane, propane, butane, toluene, ethylene, and ammonia). Diverse enzymes catalyze these oxidative reactions with chlorinated solvents. Synthesis of most of these enzymes is induced by the presence of the growth-supporting substrate and is largely regulated at the level of gene transcription. The genes that code for a given oxygenase are usually clustered together in a single operon and often share homology with counterparts that code for the subunits of related oxygenases in other bacteria. During cometabolism the growth-supporting and non-growth-supporting substrates can both bind to the oxygenase. Transformation of chlorinated solvents by these enzymes presents the cell with a new set of compounds. Some of these compounds are toxic to the cells, others are stable products that are expelled from the cell, and in a few cases the cells utilize the products. The combined effects of cometabolism can have a profound influence on a cell.},

Fe(II) can function as an electron source for iron-oxidizing microorganisms under both oxic and anoxic conditions and Fe(III) can function as a terminal electron acceptor under anoxic conditions for iron-reducing microorganisms. Given that iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, iron redox reactions have the potential to support substantial microbial populations in soil and sedimentary environments. As such, biological iron apportionment has been described as one of the most ancient forms of microbial metabolism on Earth, and as a conceivable extraterrestrial metabolism on other iron-mineral-rich planets such as Mars. Furthermore, the metabolic versatility of the microorganisms involved in these reactions has resulted in the development of biotechnological applications to remediate contaminated environments and harvest energy.},

abstract = {Cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) is a compound of concern at many chloroethene-contaminated sites, since it tends to accumulate during reductive dechlorination of the higher chlorinated ethenes. Stable carbon isotope fractionation during aerobic cDCE biodegradation was observed in groundwater microcosms under varying incubation conditions (room temperature/groundwater temperature; with/without inorganic nutrients), and resulted in an average stable carbon isotope enrichment factor of -15.2 ± 0.5‰. A new enrichment culture, obtained from groundwater microcosms, degraded cDCE concentrations up to 100 mg L-1, was active at temperatures between 4 and 23 °C, had a pH optimum of ∼7, and could withstand prolonged periods (250 d) of starvation. Microbial growth during degradation of cDCE as sole carbon and energy source was demonstrated by protein formation in mineral medium not containing any known auxiliary substrate. The obtained growth yield was 12.5 ± 1.9 g of protein Mol-1 of cDCE, with a doubling time of 53 ± 2 h at 23 °C. Aerobic degradation of cDCE as sole carbon and energy source appears to be a promising biological process for site remediation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{FAO2009,
abstract = {By 2050 the world's population will reach 9.1 billion, 34 percent higher than today. Nearly all of this population increase will occur in developing countries. Urbanization will continue at an accelerated pace, and about 70 percent of the world's population will be urban (compared to 49 percent today). Income levels will be many multiples of what they are now. In order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production (net of food used for biofuels) must increase by 70 percent. Annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today and annual meat production will need to rise by over 200 million tonnes to reach 470 million tonnes. This report argues that the required increase in food production can be achieved if the necessary investment is undertaken and policies conducive to agricultural production are put in place. But increasing production is not sufficient to achieve food security. It must be complemented by policies to enhance access by fighting poverty, especially in rural areas, as well as effective safety net programmes. Total average annual net investment in developing country agriculture required to deliver the necessary production increases would amount to USD 83 billion. The global gap in what is required vis-{\`{a}}-vis current investment levels can be illustrated by comparing the required annual gross investment of US{\$}209 billion (which includes the cost of renewing depreciating investments) with the result of a separate study that estimated that developing countries on average invested USD 142 billion (USD of 2009) annually in agriculture over the past decade. The required increase is thus about 50 percent. These figures are totals for public and private investment, i.e. investments by farmers. Achieving them will require a major reallocation in developing country budgets as well as in donor programmes. It will also require policies that support farmers in developing countries and encourage them and other private participants in agriculture to increase their investment. In developing countries, 80 percent of the necessary production increases would come from increases in yields and cropping intensity and only 20 percent from expansion of arable land. But the fact is that globally the rate of growth in yields of the major cereal crops has been steadily declining, it dropped from 3.2 percent per year in 1960 to 1.5 percent in 2000. The challenge for technology is to reverse this decline, since a continuous linear increase in yields at a global level following the pattern established over the past five decades will not be sufficient to meet food needs. Although investment in agricultural R{\&}D continues to be one of the most productive investments, with rates of return between 30 and 75 percent, it has been neglected in most low income countries. Currently, agricultural R{\&}D in developing countries is dominated by the public sector, so that initially additional investment will have to come from government budgets. Increasing private sector investment will require addressing issues of intellectual property rights while ensuring that a balance is struck so that access of smallholder farmers to new technologies is not reduced. Hunger can persist in the midst of adequate aggregate supplies because of lacking income opportunities for the poor and the absence of effective social safety nets. Experience of countries that have succeeded in reducing hunger and malnutrition shows that economic growth does not automatically ensure success, the source of growth matters too. Growth originating in agriculture, in particular the smallholder sector, is at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest as growth from non-agriculture sectors. This is not surprising since 75 percent of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas and their incomes are directly or indirectly linked to agriculture. The fight against hunger also requires targeted and deliberate action in the form of comprehensive social services, including food assistance, health and sanitation, as well as education and training; with a special focus on the most vulnerable. Many countries will continue depending on international trade to ensure their food security. It is estimated that by 2050 developing countries' net imports of cereals will more than double from 135 million metric tonnes in 2008/09 to 300 million in 2050. That is why there is a need to move towards a global trading system that is fair and competitive; and that contributes to a dependable market for food. Reform of farm support policies in OECD countries is a welcome step which has led to a decline in the aggregate trade distortion coefficient from 0.96 in 1986 to 0.74 in 2007. However, there is clearly still room for improvement. There is also a need to provide support and greater market access to developing country farmers so that they can compete on a more equal footing. Countries also need to consider joint measures to be better prepared for future shocks to the global system, through coordinated action in case of food crises, reform of trade rules, and joint finance to assist people affected by a new price spike or localized disasters. Climate change and increased biofuel production represent major risks for long-term food security. Although countries in the Southern hemisphere are not the main originators of climate change, they may suffer the greatest share of damage in the form of declining yields and greater frequency of extreme weather events. Studies estimate that the aggregate negative impact of climate change on African agricultural output up to 2080-2100 could be between 15 and 30 percent. Agriculture will have to adapt to climate change, but it can also help mitigate the effects of climate change, and useful synergies exist between adaptation and mitigation. Biofuel production based on agricultural commodities increased more than threefold from 2000 to 2008,. In 2007-08 total usage of coarse grains for the production of ethanol reached 110 million tonnes, about 10 percent of global production. Increased use of food crops for biofuel production could have serious implications for food security. A recent study estimates that continued rapid expansion of biofuel production up to 2050 would lead to the number of undernourished pre-school children in Africa and South Asia being 3 and 1.7 million higher than would have been otherwise the case. Therefore, policies promoting the use of food- based biofuels need to be reconsidered with the aim of reducing the competition between food and fuel for scarce resources. The world has the resources and technology to eradicate hunger and ensure long-term food security for all, in spite of many challenges and risks. It needs to mobilize political will and build the necessary institutions to ensure that key decisions on investment and policies to eradicate hunger are taken and implemented effectively. The time to act is now.},

abstract = {An upward-flowing subsurface supply wetland designed to mimic natural wetland systems shows evidence of sequential dechlorination of PCE in contaminated groundwater. An inherent microzonation in the rhizosphere of plants that extend roots over 1 m into the soil apparently sustains communities of microbes responsible for both anaerobic and aerobic activity. PCE dechlorination and production of methane near the bottom of the soil column suggest that anaerobic or reducing conditions exist there, but core samples indicate roots may create oxygen-enriched zones throughout the depth of the wetland. Methane is available to stimulate oxidative co-metabolism via methane monooxygenases and those enzymes may be responsible for removal of trichloroethene (TCE) microzones where higher levels of oxygen is supplied by abundant roots. Samples taken during different seasons show elevated degradation during the warmer months but mid-winter samples show significant removal of PCE and its breakdown products. Herbaceous plants derived from local wetland species grew well and did not appear to be visibly harmed by the PCE or its by-products. Core sampling of the root system indicates that more roots are found when a mixture of wetland plant species are planted. Bench-scale experiments with 14C labeled TCE show that wetland plants can also play a role in bioremediation by venting volatiles to the atmosphere. We suggest that minor modifications such as increased organic matter in the soil may lead to more rapid establishment of wetland performance. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {The importance of extremely slow retention and release has superseded the notion that sorption of pesticides to soil is an instantaneous and reversible process. A fraction of sorbed pesticide is also often reported to bind irreversibly to the soil matrix. This has important implications for pesticide mobility and bioavailability. It is essential to understand sorption phenomena to allow accurate prediction of pesticide fate within the soil environment. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis describes the result of applying a sequential extraction procedure, based on the principles of isotope or “self-exchange”, to nine pesticide/soil systems. The significance of irreversible sorption in controlling pesticide mobility was assessed using isotope exchange (12C and 14C) to characterise pesticide exchange kinetics in-situ over protracted time-scales. Sequential extraction increased in harshness in the order: isotope exchange {\textless} forced isotope exchange {\textless} solvent extraction. Three pesticides (one neutral, one basic, one acidic) and three temperate, arable soils (ranging in texture and pH) were studied. A three-site sorption model was developed to further interpret the data obtained. Although results showed the experimental design of the isotope exchange technique was not powerful enough to identify whether remaining sorbed pesticide was participating in slowly reversible or irreversible sorption, the forced isotope exchange procedure was able to provide an indication of amounts of pesticide not participating in exchange between the soil and solution. Under abiotic conditions, only minimal amounts of initial-applied pesticide were found to take part in irreversible binding. Soil combustion quantified irreversible sorption in the order: chlorotoluron (≤ 2.27 ± 0.36{\%}) {\textgreater} prometryn (≤ 1.35 ± 0.60{\%}) {\textgreater} hexaconazole (≤ 0.50 ± 0.06{\%}). Varying the soil composition had little effect on amounts of irreversibly sorbed pesticide, probably due to the small amounts of irreversible sorption observed overall. These results suggest that the vast majority of sorbed chlorotoluron, prometryn and hexaconazole (in the parent form) participated in very slow but reversible binding, a result also confirmed by the three-site sorption model. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nPesticide sorption behaviour is a complex process. Although sorption phenomena are still not fully understood, these results provide a greater insight into the significance of irreversible binding for predicting pesticide fate.},

abstract = {The anaerobic biodegradation of tetrachloroethene commonly results in the accumulation of chlorinated intermediates such as cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). Frequently, groundwater contaminated with chlorinated ethenes discharges to natural wetlands. The goal of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the effects of wetland plants and microorganisms on the fate of cDCE in the wetland rhizosphere. To accomplish this goal, a novel dual-compartment wetland microcosm was designed. A Phragmites australis individual was maintained in the microcosm, which was operated with continuous flows of air and mineral medium through the foliar and rhizosphere compartments, respectively, to incorporate mass transfer/transport processes that are important in natural wetlands and allow steady-state assessment of changes in dissolved O2 and cDCE or [1,2-(14)C]cDCE levels. Substantial amounts of [14C]cDCE were phytovolatilized through a healthy P. australis individual to the foliar chamber. Rhizodegradation by native microorganisms associated with P. australis roots also converted substantial amounts of [14C]cDCE to 14C-labeled CO2 and non-volatile compounds, presumably through cometabolic reactions that could be enhanced by the release of O2 and exudates by P. australis. These results suggest that, in some cases, the intrinsic capacity of native wetland plants and microorganisms to remove cDCE from the rhizosphere may be substantial.},

abstract = {Although both raindrop driven processes and diffusion play important roles in the transfer of chemicals from soil to surface runoff, current transport models either do not consider the two processes together, or use `effective' parameters with uncertain physical definitions. We developed a physically based, solute transport model that couples both mechanisms and tested it with laboratory experiments. One unique aspect of this study is that all the parameters were either directly measured or previously published, that is, there was no model `calibration' or `fitting.' Our model assumes that chemicals near the surface of the soil are ejected into runoff by raindrop impact and chemicals deeper in the soil diffuse into a surface layer, or `exchange layer,' via diffusion. The exchange layer depth and transfer processes are derived from the `shield' concept in the Rose soil erosion model (e.g. Rose, 1985). The model's governing equations were solved numerically and the results agreed well with experimental data (R2{\textgreater}0.90). The model's sensitivity to various physical and chemical parameters illuminated the importance of both raindrop controlled processes and diffusion on chemical transport from soil to surface runoff.},

abstract = {The oxidative degradation of organic matter is a key process in the biogeochemical functioning of the earth system. Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {This tutorial is designed to give the reader an understanding of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). PCA is a useful statistical technique that has found application in fields such as face recognition and image compression, and is a common technique for finding patterns in data of high dimension. Before getting to a description of PCA, this tutorial first introduces mathematical concepts that will be used in PCA. It covers standard deviation, covariance, eigenvec- tors and eigenvalues. This background knowledge is meant to make the PCA section very straightforward, but can be skipped if the concepts are already familiar. There are examples all the way through this tutorial that are meant to illustrate the concepts being discussed. If further information is required, the mathematics textbook Elementary Linear Algebra 5e by Howard Anton, Publisher JohnWiley {\&} Sons Inc, ISBN 0-471-85223-6 is a good source of information regarding the mathematical back- ground. 1},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) using gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) has developed into a mature analytical method in many application areas over the last decade. This is in particular true for carbon isotope analysis, whereas measurements of the other elements amenable to CSIA (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen) are much less routine. In environmental sciences, successful applications to date include (i) the allocation of contaminant sources on a local, regional, and global scale, (ii) the identification and quantification of (bio)transformation reactions on scales ranging from batch experiments to contaminated field sites, and (iii) the characterization of elementary reaction mechanisms that govern product formation. These three application areas are discussed in detail. The investigated spectrum of compounds comprises mainly n-alkanes, monoaromatics such as benzene and toluene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloromethane, trichloroethylene, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Future research directions are primarily set by the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and method development. Approaches to utilize HPLC separation in CSIA, the enhancement of sensitivity of CSIA to allow field investigations in the microg L(-1) range, and the development of methods for CSIA of other elements are reviewed. Furthermore, an alternative scheme to evaluate isotope data is outlined that would enable estimates of position-specific kinetic isotope effects and, thus, allow one to extract mechanistic chemical and biochemical information.},

abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

abstract = {The past decade has seen considerable progress in the development of models simulating pesticide transport in structured soils subject to preferential flow (PF). Most PF pesticide transport models are based on the two-region concept and usually assume one (vertical) dimensional flow and transport. Stochastic parameter sets are sometimes used to account for the effects of spatial variability at the field scale. In the past decade, PF pesticide models were also coupled with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and groundwater flow models for application at the catchment and larger regional scales. A review of PF pesticide model applications reveals that the principal difficulty of their application is still the appropriate parameterization of PF and pesticide processes. Experimental solution strategies involve improving measurement techniques and experimental designs. Model strategies aim at enhancing process descriptions, studying parameter sensitivity, uncertainty, inverse parameter identification, model calibration, and effects of spatial variability, as well as generating model emulators and databases. Model comparison studies demonstrated that, after calibration, PF pesticide models clearly outperform chromatographic models for structured soils. Considering nonlinear and kinetic sorption reactions further enhanced the pesticide transport description. However, inverse techniques combined with typically available experimental data are often limited in their ability to simultaneously identify parameters for describing PF, sorption, degradation and other processes. On the other hand, the predictive capacity of uncalibrated PF pesticide models currently allows at best an approximate (order-of-magnitude) estimation of concentrations. Moreover, models should target the entire soil-plant-atmosphere system, including often neglected above-ground processes such as pesticide volatilization, interception, sorption to plant residues, root uptake, and losses by runoff. The conclusions compile progress, problems, and future research choices for modelling pesticide displacement in structured soils. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A novel one-step similarity approach for the regionalization of hydrological parameters has been developed. The method automatically associates model parameters (MP) with catchment descriptors (CD), using techniques based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM-B). The combination of the one-step approach with the automatic association reduces the problem of equifinality and avoids subjective predefinition of relationships between CDs and MPs. Further positive properties of the SOM-B are the feasibility to use discrete variables as CDs and the ability to capture interdependencies between MPs. The SOM-B was validated against a known one-step regionalization method which is based on linear transfer functions (LT-B). Furthermore the influence of different factors like combination CDs, or size of the SOM, on the regionalization performance of the SOM-B was analyzed. The hydrological model used for the evaluations was a modified version of the HBV-IWS, which simulates continuous hourly discharge series. The investigations were carried out in 41 catchments of the Aller-Leine river basin in Northern Germany. For the validation a spatial split-sampling in 12 donor and 29 validation catchments, as well as a temporal split-sampling were applied. The results showed that: (I) MPs regionalized with the SOM-B approach led to similar or slightly better model performance than with the LT-B method, (II) some hydrologically plausible relationships between MPs and CDs were adjusted automatically without any predefinition by the SOM-B, (III) the relationships between CDs and MPs were more transparent using the SOM-B approach, (IV) the sensitivity of different factors of the SOM-B on the performance was smaller than expected. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Optimization of crop factors and hydraulic properties was found to be an ill posed problem and all algorithms failed to identify reliable global minima for the hydrological parameters.

PD{\_}MS2 was well suitable for a quick parameter search. The linear parameter uncertainty intervals estimated by LM and PD{\_}MS2 were usually larger than by the non-linear method used by SCEM.

@article{Elsneretal2005,
abstract = {Measuring stable isotope fractionation of carbon, hydrogen, and other elements by Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) is a new, innovative approach to assess organic pollutant degradation in the environment. Central to this concept is the Rayleigh equation which relates degradation-induced decreases in concentrations directly to concomitant changes in bulk (= average over the whole compound) isotope ratios. The extent of in situ transformation may therefore be inferred from measured isotope ratios in field samples, provided that an appropriate enrichment factor ($\epsilon$bulk) is known. This $\epsilon$bulk value, however, is usually only valid for a specific compound and for specific degradation conditions. Therefore, a direct comparison of $\epsilon$bulk values for different compounds and for different types of reactions has in general not been feasible. In addition, it is often uncertain how robust and reproducible $\epsilon$bulk values are and how confidently they can be used to quantify contaminant degradation in the field. To improve this situation and to achieve a more in-depth understanding, this critical review aims to relate fundamental insight about kinetic isotope effects (KIE) found in the physico(bio)chemical literature to apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIE) derived from $\epsilon$bulk values reported in environmentally oriented studies. Starting from basic rate laws, a quite general derivation of the Rayleigh equation is given, resulting in a novel set of simple equations that take into account the effects of (1) nonreacting positions and (2) intramolecular competition and that lead to position-specific AKIE values rather than bulk enrichment factors. Reevaluation of existing $\epsilon$bulk literature values result in consistent ranges of AKIE values that generally are in good agreement with previously published data in the (bio)chemical literature and are typical of certain degradation reactions (subscripts C and H indicate values for carbon and hydrogen):? AKIEC = 1.01?1.03 and AKIEH = 2?23 for oxidation of C?H bonds; AKIEC = 1.03?1.07 for SN2-reactions; AKIEC = 1.02?1.03 for reductive cleavage of C?Cl bonds; AKIEC = 1.00?1.01 for CC bond epoxidation; AKIEC = 1.02?1.03 for CC bond oxidation by permanganate. Hence, the evaluation scheme presented bridges a gap between basic and environmental (bio)chemistry and provides insight into factors that control the magnitude of bulk isotope fractionation factors. It also serves as a basis to identify degradation pathways using isotope data. It is shown how such an analysis may be even possible in complex field situations and/or in cases where AKIE values are smaller than intrinsic KIE values, provided that isotope fractionation is measured for two elements simultaneously (?two-dimensional isotope analysis?). Finally, the procedure is used (1) to point out the possibility of estimating approximate $\epsilon$bulk values for new compounds and (2) to discuss the moderate, but non-negligible variability that may quite generally be associated with $\epsilon$bulk values. Future research is suggested to better understand and take into account the various factors that may cause such variability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper discusses U.S. agricultural pesticide use trends from 1964 to 2010 based on estimates developed from USDA surveys, and the influence of economic factors, agricultural policy, and pesticide regulation on aggregate quantities and mix of pesticides used. RESULTS: Synthetic organic pesticide use grew dramatically from the 1960s to the early 1980s, as farmers treated more and more acreage. Use then stabilized, with herbicides applied to about 95{\%} of corn, cotton, and soybean acres, annually. Subsequently, major factors affecting trends were: (1) changes in crop acreage and other economic factors, (2) use of new pesticides that reduced per-acre application rates and/or met more rigorous health and environmental standards, and (3) adoption of genetically engineered insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops. CONCLUSION: The use of pesticides and other control practices responded to economic factors such as input and output markets and agricultural policies. Changing societal values toward pesticide risks and benefits profoundly affected pesticide policy, influencing the pesticides available for use, but only indirectly affecting aggregate quantities used. While the current pesticide regulatory process might have economic inefficiencies, it might be consistent with policy preferences held by much of the public-to reduce pesticide hazards rather than minimize regulatory costs.},

For cis-1,2-DCE, dechlorination occurred simultaneously with sulfite and sulfate reduction but competitive exclusion of methanogenesis was observed due to the rapid H(2) drawdown by the dehalorespiring bacteria. Rates of cis-1,2-DCE dechlorination decreased proportionally to the free energy yield of the competing electron acceptor and proportionally to the rate of H(2) drawdown, suggesting that H(2) competition between dehalorespirers and other populations was occurring, affecting the dechlorination rate. For 1,2-DCA, dechlorination occurred simultaneously with methanogenesis and sulfate reduction but occurred only after sulfite was completely depleted. Rates of 1,2-DCA dechlorination were unaffected by the presence of competing electron-accepting processes. The absence of a low H(2) threshold suggests that 1,2-DCA dechlorination is a cometabolic transformation, occurring at a higher H(2) threshold, despite the high free energy yields available for dehalorespiration of 1,2-DCA. We demonstrate the utility of kinetic and thermodynamic calculations to understand the complex, H(2)-utilizing reactions occurring in the wetland bed and their effect on rates of dechlorination of priority pollutants.},

Woody biomass production (B w ) in the first year was analysed as the product of the proportion of dry matter partitioned to wood ($\eta$¯), the seasonal mean efficiency with which intercepted light was used to produce dry matter (ɛ¯), the mean fraction of incident light intercepted by the canopies (f¯), and the amount of incoming solar radiation over the season (A). Thus, Bw = $\eta$¯f¯ɛ¯A. For Salix , B w =10 t ha −1 y −1 , while for Populus , B w = 5 t ha −1 y −1 , mainly because of differences in $\eta$¯ and f¯. The Populus partitioned more dry matter to roots (and correspondingly less to stems) and intercepted less light over the growing season. The Salix and Populus clones had surprisingly similar (ɛ¯) values, namely 1. 58 and 1. 50 g MJ −1 , respectively (based on total dry matter and total solar radiation), which are very like the ɛ¯ values measured on C 3 agricultural crops in Britain. Also, the Salix and Populus clones produced canopies with similar light extinction coefficients and hence similar relationships between fractional interception and leaf area index.},

For soils, the MESA adsorption constant is statistically higher than that of MOXA and the sorption constants of the two metabolites are significantly lower than that of SMOC. After 246 days, for soils, maximums of 26{\%} of the SMOC, 30{\%} of the MESA and 38{\%} of the MOXA were mineralized. This partly explains the presence of these metabolites in the groundwater at concentrations generally higher than those of the parent molecule for MESA, although there is no statistical difference in the mineralization of the 3 molecules. The laboratory results make it possible to explain the field observations made during 27 months of groundwater quality monitoring (monthly sampling frequency). The evolution of both metabolite concentrations in the groundwater is directly related to recharge dynamics; there is a positive correlation between concentrations and the groundwater level. The observed lag of several months between the signals of the parent molecule and those of the metabolites is probably due to greater sorption of the parent molecule than of its metabolites and/or to degradation kinetics. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Assessing changes in the isotopic signature of contaminants is a promising new tool to monitor microbial degradation processes. In this study, chloroethene degradation was proven by depletion of chloroethenes, formation of chloride, increase in protein content and stable carbon isotope fractionation. Aerobic degradation of vinyl chloride (VC) was found to proceed metabolically, with degradation rates of 0.48 and 0.29 d-1; and growth yields of 9.7 and 6.4 g of protein/mol of VC at room and groundwater temperature, respectively. Cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) was degraded cometabolically under aerobic conditions when VC was provided as growth substrate. Aerobic degradation was associated with significant stable carbon isotope fractionation, with enrichment factors ranging from -5.4??0.4??? for metabolic degradation of VC to -9.8??1.7??? for cometabolic degradation of cDCE. Thus, it was demonstrated that stable carbon isotope fractionation is suitable for assessing aerobic chloroethene degradation, which can contribute significantly to site remediation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Compared with nutrient levels and habitat degradation, the importance of agricultural pesticides in surface water may have been underestimated due to a lack of comprehensive quantitative analysis. Increasing pesticide contamination results in decreasing regional aquatic biodiversity, i.e., macroinvertebrate family richness is reduced by ∼30{\%} at pesticide concentrations equaling the legally accepted regulatory threshold levels (RTLs). This study provides a comprehensive metaanalysis of 838 peer-reviewed studies ({\textgreater}2,500 sites in 73 countries) that evaluates, for the first time to our knowledge on a global scale, the exposure of surface waters to particularly toxic agricultural insecticides. We tested whether measured insecticide concentrations (MICs; i.e., quantified insecticide concentrations) exceed their RTLs and how risks depend on insecticide development over time and stringency of environmental regulation. Our analysis reveals that MICs occur rarely (i.e., an estimated 97.4{\%} of analyses conducted found no MICs) and there is a complete lack of scientific monitoring data for ∼90{\%} of global cropland. Most importantly, of the 11,300 MICs, 52.4{\%} (5,915 cases; 68.5{\%} of the sites) exceeded the RTL for either surface water (RTLSW) or sediments. Thus, the biological integrity of global water resources is at a substantial risk. RTLSW exceedances depend on the catchment size, sampling regime, and sampling date; are significantly higher for newer-generation insecticides (i.e., pyrethroids); and are high even in countries with stringent environmental regulations. These results suggest the need for worldwide improvements to current pesticide regulations and agricultural pesticide application practices and for intensified research efforts on the presence and effects of pesticides under real-world conditions.},

The sensitivity of the predicted discharge to the initial condition of soil moisture appears to depend highly on all factors: infiltration model, event properties, topsoil/subsoil depth configuration and the level of the initial condition itself. There are interaction effects between all the factors. However, the effect of the different infiltration models is most pronounced. The Green-Ampt model shows less sensitivity to moisture content variation of both top and subsoil. Top/subsoil depth configuration rarely influences the results of the Green-Ampt model. The Richards model shows a highly variable discharge - initial soil moisture relation with changing rainfall intensity and topsoil/subsoil depth configurations. Two methods of sensitivity analysis, relative sensitivity and One factor-At-a Time sensitivity, have been used. The two methods gave comparable results. Depending on the other parameter values, 1{\%} changes in topsoil moisture content resulted into 0.8-1.81{\%} and 0.03-3.5{\%} changes in total discharge predicted by the Green-Ampt and Richards models, respectively. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The fastest degradation of cDCE was observed in the absence of any other chloroethene. In the presence of a second chloroethene (40–90 $\mu$M), the rate of cDCE (60 $\mu$M) degradation decreased in the following order: cDCE (+PCE) {\textgreater} cDCE (+tDCE) {\textgreater} cDCE (+VC){\textgreater} cDCE (+1,1DCE) ≈ cDCE (+TCE). With increasing concentrations of VC, ranging from 10 to 110 $\mu$M, the rate of cDCE (60 $\mu$M) degradation decreased. This study demonstrates that the inhibiting effects of chloroethene mixtures have to be considered during laboratory studies and bioremediation approaches based on metabolic cDCE degradation.},

In this study, CSIA was developed to analyse the stable carbon isotope signatures of the widely used organophosphorus pesticides: dichlorvos, omethoate and dimethoate. The linearity of the GC-C-IRMS system was tested for target pesticides and led to an acceptable isotope composition within the uncertainty of the instrument. In order to assess the accuracy of the developed method, the effect of the evaporation procedure on measured carbon isotope composition ($\delta$(13)C) values was studied and showed that concentration by evaporation of solvents had no significant isotope effect. The CSIA was then applied to investigate isotope fractionation of the hydrolysis and photolysis of selected pesticides. The carbon isotope fractionation of tested pesticides was quantified by the Rayleigh model, which revealed a bulk enrichment factor ($\epsilon$) of -0.2±0.1‰ for hydrolysis of dichlorvos, -1.0±0.1‰ and -3.7±1.1‰ for hydrolysis and photolysis of dimethoate respectively. This study is a first step towards the application of CSIA to trace the transport and degradation of organophosphorus pesticides in the environment.},

Here, we investigated the magnitude and variability of C and N isotope fractionation during the indirect phototransformation of four para-substituted anilines in aerated aqueous solutions. The model photosensitizers, namely 9,10-anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate and methylene blue, were used as surrogates for dissolved organic matter chromophores generating excited triplet states in sunlit surface waters. The transformation of aniline, 4-CH3-, 4-OCH3-, and 4-Cl-aniline by excited triplet states of the photosensitizers was associated with inverse and normal N isotope fractionation, whereas C isotope fractionation was negligible. The apparent 15N kinetic isotope effects (AKIE) were almost identical for both photosensitizers, increased from 0.9958 ± 0.0013 for 4-OCH3-aniline to 1.0035 ± 0.0006 for 4-Cl-aniline, and correlated well with the electron donating properties of the substituent. N isotope fractionation is pH-dependent in that H+ exchange reactions dominate below and N atom oxidation processes above the pKa value of the substituted aniline's conjugate acid. Correlations of C and N isotope fractionation for indirect phototransformation were different from those determined previously for the direct photolysis of chloroanilines and offer new opportunities to distinguish between abiotic degradation pathways.},

abstract = {In this study, we used a two-dimensional (2D) mechanistic mathematical model in order to evaluate the relative contribution of different microbial reactions to organic matter removal (in terms of COD) in horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands that treated urban wastewater. We also used the model to analyse the effect of increasing or decreasing the organic loading rate (changing the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) at a constant influent organic matter concentration, or changing the organic matter concentration at a constant HLR) on both the removal efficiency and the relative importance of the microbial reactions. The model is based on the code RetrasoCodeBright, which we modified to include the main microbial processes related to organic matter and nitrogen transformations in the wetlands: hydrolysis, aerobic respiration, nitrification, denitrification, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis. The model was calibrated and validated with data from two wetlands (each with a surface area of 55 m
                        2) located in a pilot plant near Barcelona (Spain). According to the simulations, anaerobic processes (methanogenesis and sulphate reduction) are more widespread in the wetlands and contribute to a higher COD removal rate (60-70{\%}) than anoxic (denitrification) and aerobic reactions do. These model results are confirmed by experimental observations. In all the cases tested, the reaction that most contributed to COD removal was methanogenesis (33-52{\%}). According to our simulations, decreasing the HLR (for example, from 40 to 25 mm/d) while maintaining a constant COD influent concentration has a clear positive impact on COD removal efficiency (which increases from 65{\%} to 89{\%}). Changing influent COD concentration (for example, from 290 to 190 mg/L) while maintaining a constant HLR has a smaller impact, causing efficiency to increase from 79{\%} to 84{\%}. Changes in influent COD concentration (at a constant HLR) affect the relative contribution of the microbial reactions to organic matter removal. However, this trend is not seen when the HLR changes and the COD influent concentration remains constant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Rayleigh equation relates the change in isotope ratio of an element in a substrate to the extent of substrate consumption via a single kinetic isotopic fractionation factor (alpha). Substrate consumption is, however, commonly distributed over several metabolic pathways each potentially having a different alpha. Therefore, extended Rayleigh-type equations were derived to account for multiple competing degradation pathways. The value of alpha as expressed in the environment appears a function of the alpha values and rate constants of the various involved degradation pathways. Remarkably, the environmental or apparent alpha value changes and shows non-Rayleigh behavior over a large and relevant concentration interval if Monod kinetics applies and the half-saturation constants of the competing pathways differ. Derived equations were applied to previously published data and enabled (i) quantification of the share that two competing degradation pathways had on aerobic 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) biodegradation in laboratory batch experiments and (ii) calculation of the extent of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) biodegradation shared over aerobic and anaerobic degradation at a field site by means of an improved solution to two-dimensional (carbon and hydrogen) compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA).},

Comparatively little is known about individual stereoisomers of pollutants, which can have differential toxicological effects and can be tracers of biochemical weathering in the environment. Stereoisomers are resolved by gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Separation techniques in environmental analysis are typically coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), as these provide the sensitivity and selectivity needed. The enantiomer composition of phenoxyalkanoic and acetamide herbicides, organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides, chiral polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites, synthetic musks, hexabromocyclododecane, and pharmaceuticals in the environment show species-dependent enantioselectivity from biotransformation and other biologically mediated processes affecting enantiomers differentially.

Theoretical frameworks and models for describing the transfer process were also reviewed. The existing models were classified into four categories based on their principles: mixing-layer models, interfacial diffusion-controlled models, interfacial-diffusion and rainfall-dispersion models, and empirical models. The assumptions, parameters, applications, limitations or potential issues, and further improvements for each category of the models were discussed. It is recommended that new experimental methods be developed and current theoretical frameworks be further refined by considering the effects of other environmental factors and transport mechanisms on solute transfer from the soil surface to overland flow so that the models can be applied to a wider range of practical field conditions.},

abstract = {Reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) by zero-valent iron produces a systematic enrichment of 13C in the remaining substrate that can be described using a Rayleigh model. In this study, fractionation factors for TCE dechlorination with iron samples from two permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) were established in batch experiments. Samples included original unused iron as well as material from a barrier in Belfast after almost 4 years of operation. Despite the variety of samples, carbon isotope fractionations of TCE were remarkably similar and seemed to be independent of iron origin, reaction rate, and formation of precipitates on the iron surfaces. The average enrichment factor for all experiments was -10.1??? (??0.4???). These results indicate that the enrichment factor provides a powerful tool to monitor the reaction progress, and thus the performance, of an iron-reactive barrier over time. The strong fractionation observed may also serve as a tool to distinguish between insufficient residence time in the wall and a possible bypassing of the wall by the plume, which should result in an unchanged isotopic signature of the TCE. Although further work is necessary to apply this stable isotope method in the field, it has potential to serve as a unique monitoring tool for PRBs based on zero-valent iron. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) of contaminants is an emerging technique to characterize in situ microbial activity. The kinetic isotope effect in microbial degradation reactions, or enzyme catalysis, is caused by the preferential cleavage of bonds containing light rather than heavy isotopes. This leads to a relative enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the residual substrate pool. However, a number of nonisotopically sensitive steps preceding the isotopically sensitive bond cleavage may affect the reaction kinetics of a degradation process, thus reducing the observed (i.e., the macroscopically detectable) isotope fractionation. Low bioavailability of contaminants poses kinetic limitations on the biodegradation process and can significantly reduce the observed kinetic isotope fractionation. Here we present experimental evidence for the influence of bioavailability-limited pollutant biodegradation on observed stable isotope fractionation. Batch laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the toluene hydrogen isotope fractionation of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (pWWO) subjected to different small concentrations of toluene with and without deuterium label, which corresponded to realistic environmental mass transfer scenarios. Detected isotope fractionations depended significantly on the toluene concentration, hence confirming the influence of substrate mass transfer limitation on observed isotope fractionation, hypothesized by Thullner et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42,6544-6551). Our results indicate that the bioavailability of a substrate should be considered during quantitative analysis of microbial degradation based on SIFA.},

abstract = {We investigated the biogeochemical cycling of silicon (Si) in an acidic brown soil covered by a coniferous forest (Douglas fir). Based on published and original data, we constructed a conceptual model and used a modified version of the reactive transport code MIN3P for model testing and quantification purposes. The model was first calibrated and further validated with respect to biomass data and Si-concentrations in capillary solutions, which were collected monthly over several years by means of suction-cup lysimeters placed at different soil depths.  Following sensitivity tests, the model was calibrated quite accurately (limited to a 10{\%} concentration error) by the adjustment of kinetic constants, longitudinal dispersion, and apparent activation energy for K-feldspar dissolution. Calibrated parameter values were constrained by ranges reported in the literature, when available. Mass balance calculations indicate that an average of 60{\%} of the biogeochemical cycle of Si was controlled by biological processes (i.e. Si-uptake and dissolution of phytoliths). Sensitivity analyses suggest that no more than 55{\%} of the Si-cycle is controlled by weathering of primary silicates. Such a large contribution of biological turnover to Si-cycling may be explained by the combined effects of a relatively large Si-content in the litter fall (i.e. specifically in the needles) and high biomass productivity of the coniferous species considered. In addition to potential implications for the global Si cycle, this investigation raises several fundamental questions concerning the nature of Si-uptake mechanisms and physiological use of Si by trees in natural systems.},

abstract = {Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of the emergent macrophyte Juncus effusus L. was measured in six plots in the Talladega Wetland Ecosystem (Hale County, AL) over diel and annual periods to evaluate the effects of water table fluctuations on photosynthesis and water losses. Half of the plots were in the areas where sediments remained saturated annually (stable water table) and the remaining plots were in the areas where water table heights fluctuated and sediments (upper 20 cm) did not remain continuously saturated. Annual patterns of average net photosynthesis were similar among all sample plots at the wetland (p {\textgreater} 0.05; repeated measures ANOVA), which suggested that no differences in net photosynthesis resulted from the observed differences in sediment saturation. A marked seasonal pattern of net photosynthesis occurred with the greatest average photosynthesis during winter, summer (1997), and spring (11.0. 10.2, and 9.03 ??mol CO2m-2 s-1, respectively) compared to autumn and summer (1996) (6.64 and 5.93 ??mol CO2m-2 s-1, respectively). Average apparent photosynthetic efficiency of J. effusus was 1.43{\%} and varied seasonally with the highest values in winter (1.86{\%}) followed by spring (1.69{\%}), autumn (1.34{\%}), and summer (0.80 and 1.13{\%}; 1996 and 1997, respectively). Although significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in stomatal conductance occurred among sample plots within the wetland, no correlation was found between stomatal conductance and sample plot location or sediment saturation within the wetland. Seasonally, greater transpiration by J. effusus occurred during the summer (1996) and autumn months (0.43 and 0.28 mol H2O m-2 s-1, respectively) compared to winter, spring, and summer (1997) (0.22, 0.20, and 0.16 mol H2O m-2 s-1, respectively). Seasonal measurements of diel photosynthesis and stomatal conductance showed that daily net photosynthesis was variable among sample plots and among the seasons at the wetland, with maximum photosynthesis from 1000 to 1400 hours. Diel measurements of stomatal conductance showed significantly higher transpirative water loss during evening hours compared to high light periods.},

Similar fractionation factors were estimated for benzene (1.00017), 2,4-dimethylphenol (1.00035), and o-xylene ({\textless} or = 1.00092) from chromatographic experiments. The latter method is based on chromatographic amplification of the fractionation effect (deltadelta13C) in an HPLC column with humic acid (HA) as the stationary phase. Possible implications of the sorption-based isotope fractionation for assessment of natural attenuation processes in contaminated aquifers are discussed. Depending on the aquifer properties (organic carbon content, heterogeneity) together with the plume source, length, and status (stationary or expanding), scenarios may be constructed where sorption-based isotope fractionation competes significantly with that caused by chemical or microbial degradation processes.},

@article{Murphy2000,
abstract = {The incorporation of microbial processes into reactive transport models has generally proceeded along two separate lines of investigation: (1) transport of bacteria as inert colloids in porous media, and (2) the biodegradation of dissolved contaminants by a stationary phase of bacteria. Research over the last decade has indicated that these processes are closely linked. This linkage may occur when a change in metabolic activity alters the attachment/detachment rates of bacteria to surfaces, either promoting or retarding bacterial transport in a groundwater-contaminant plume. Changes in metabolic activity, in turn, are controlled by the time of exposure of the microbes to electron acceptors/donor and other components affecting activity. Similarly, metabolic activity can affect the reversibility of attachment, depending on the residence time of active microbes. Thus, improvements in quantitative analysis of active subsurface biota necessitate direct linkages between substrate availability, metabolic activity, growth, and attachment/detachment rates. This linkage requires both a detailed understanding of the biological processes and robust quantitative representations of these processes that can be rested experimentally. This paper presents an overview of current approaches used to represent physicochemical and biological processes in porous media, along with new conceptual approaches that link metabolic activity with partitioning of the microorganism between the aqueous and solid phases.},

abstract = {High-resolution in situ total phosphorus (TP), total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and turbidity (TURB) time series are presented for a groundwater-dominated agricultural catchment. Meta-analysis of concentration-discharge (. c-. q) intra-storm signatures for 61 storm events revealed dominant hysteretic patterns with similar frequency of anti-clockwise and clockwise responses; different determinands (TP, TRP, TURB) behaved similarly. We found that the c-. q loop direction is controlled by seasonally variable flow discharge and temperature whereas the magnitude is controlled by antecedent rainfall. Anti-clockwise storm events showed lower flow discharge and higher temperature compared to clockwise events. Hydrological controls were more important for clockwise events and TP and TURB responses, whereas in-stream biogeochemical controls were important for anti-clockwise storm events and TRP responses. Based on the best predictors of the direction of the hysteresis loops, we calibrated and validated a simple fuzzy logic inference model (FIS) to determine likely direction of the c-. q responses. We show that seasonal and inter-storm succession in clockwise and anti-clockwise responses corroborates the transition in P transport from a chemostatic to an episodic regime. Our work delivers new insights for the evidence base on the complexity of phosphorus dynamics. We show the critical value of high-frequency in situ observations in advancing understanding of freshwater biogeochemical processes.},

These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

The identification of pathway-specific contributions to total contaminant removal is of high practical relevance, yet difficult to achieve with current methods. Current stable-isotope-fractionation-based techniques focus on the identification of dominant biodegradation pathways under constant environmental conditions. We present an approach based on dual stable isotope data to estimate the individual contributions of two redox-specific pathways. We apply this approach to carbon and hydrogen isotope data obtained from reactive transport simulations of an organic contaminant plume in a two-dimensional aquifer cross section to test the applicability of the method. To take aspects typically encountered at field sites into account, additional simulations addressed the effects of transverse mixing, diffusion-induced stable-isotope fractionation, heterogeneities in the flow field, and mixing in sampling wells on isotope-based estimates for aerobic and anaerobic pathway contributions to total contaminant biodegradation. Results confirm the general applicability of the presented estimation method which is most accurate along the plume core and less accurate towards the fringe where flow paths receive contaminant mass and associated isotope signatures from the core by transverse dispersion. The presented method complements the stable-isotope-fractionation-based analysis toolbox. At field sites with varying redox conditions, it provides a means to identify the relative importance of individual, redox-specific degradation pathways.},

abstract = {MIN3P was developed as a general purpose multicomponent reactive transport code for variably saturated media. The basic version of the code includes Richard's equation for the solution of variably-saturated flow, and solves mass balance equations for advective-diffusive solute transport and diffusive gas transport. Biogeochemical reactions are described by a partial equilibrium approach, using equilibrium-based law-of-mass-action relationships for fast reactions, and a generalized kinetic framework for reactions that are relatively slow in comparison to the transport time scale. MIN3P has been used to support multiple field and laboratory investigations involving the fate of inorganic and organic substances and has served as a platform for additional code development: MIN3P-Bubble, an enhanced version to simulate gas generation and exsolution in the saturated zone, as well as gas entrapment and release due to water table fluctuations; MIN3P-Dusty, a version of the code that includes gas advection and multicomponent gas diffusion based on the Dusty Gas Model (DGM); and MIN3P-Soil, a version that includes plant-soil interactions. The capabilities of the basic code and the follow-up developments are demonstrated by simulating the oxidation of pyrite in mine waste, associated metal release, and subsequent attenuation processes; the interactions between the formation of “excess air” and biogeochemical reactions in the vadose zone and below the water table; the evolution of vadose zone gas composition and transport processes at a petroleum hydrocarbon spill site undergoing natural attenuation; and the effect of plant-soil interactions on mineral weathering and secondary mineral formation in soils and surficial sediments. - See more at: http://www.eurekaselect.com/50542/chapter/reactive-transport-modeling-in-variably-saturated-media-with-min3p{\%}3A-basic-model-formulation-and-mode{\#}sthash.huFHhLS7.dpuf},

abstract = {Biological control of pests by natural enemies is a major ecosystem service delivered to agriculture worldwide. Quantifying and predicting its effectiveness at large spatial scales is critical for increased sustainability of agricultural production. Landscape complexity is known to benefit natural enemies, but its effects on interactions between natural enemies and the consequences for crop damage and yield are unclear. Here, we show that pest control at the landscape scale is driven by differences in natural enemy interactions across landscapes, rather than by the effectiveness of individual natural enemy guilds. In a field exclusion experiment, pest control by flying insect enemies increased with landscape complexity. However, so did antagonistic interactions between flying insects and birds, which were neutral in simple landscapes and increasingly negative in complex landscapes. Negative natural enemy interactions thus constrained pest control in complex landscapes. These results show that, by altering natural enemy interactions, landscape complexity can provide ecosystem services as well as disservices. Careful handling of the tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services, biodiversity, and societal concerns is thus crucial and depends on our ability to predict the functional consequences of landscape-scale changes in trophic interactions.},

abstract = {During the next 50 years, which is likely to be the final period of rapid agricultural expansion, demand for food by a wealthier and 50{\%} larger global population will be a major driver of global environmental change. Should past dependences of the global environmental impacts of agriculture on human population and consumption continue, 10(9) hectares of natural ecosystems would be converted to agriculture by 2050. This would be accompanied by 2.4- to 2.7-fold increases in nitrogen- and phosphorus-driven eutrophication of terrestrial, freshwater, and near-shore marine ecosystems, and comparable increases in pesticide use. This eutrophication and habitat destruction would cause unprecedented ecosystem simplification, loss of ecosystem services, and species extinctions. Significant scientific advances and regulatory, technological, and policy changes are needed to control the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion.},

abstract = {Gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) has made it possible to analyze natural stable isotope ratios (e.g., (13)C/(12)C, (15)N/(14)N, (2)H/(1)H) of individual organic contaminants in environmental samples. They may be used as fingerprints to infer contamination sources, and may demonstrate, and even quantify, the occurrence of natural contaminant transformation by the enrichment of heavy isotopes that arises from degradation-induced isotope fractionation. This review highlights an additional powerful feature of stable isotope fractionation: the study of environmental transformation mechanisms. Isotope effects reflect the energy difference of isotopologues (i.e., molecules carrying a light versus a heavy isotope in a particular molecular position) when moving from reactant to transition state. Measuring isotope fractionation, therefore, essentially allows a glimpse at transition states! It is shown how such position-specific isotope effects are "diluted out" in the compound average measured by GC-IRMS, and how a careful evaluation in mechanistic scenarios and by dual isotope plots can recover the underlying mechanistic information. The mathematical framework for multistep isotope fractionation in environmental transformations is reviewed. Case studies demonstrate how isotope fractionation changes in the presence of mass transfer, enzymatic commitment to catalysis, multiple chemical reaction steps or limited bioavailability, and how this gives information about the individual process steps. Finally, it is discussed how isotope ratios of individual products evolve in sequential or parallel transformations, and what mechanistic insight they contain. A concluding session gives an outlook on current developments, future research directions and the potential for bridging the gap between laboratory and real world systems.},

abstract = {Previous research has suggested that pesticide losses at the field scale can be dominated by a small proportion of the field area. The objective of this study was to investigate whether site-specific applications (i.e. avoiding high-risk areas) at the field scale can contribute to a reduction of pesticide leaching despite uncertainty in the underlying model-based leaching risk map. Using a meta-model of the dual-permeability model MACRO, the annual average pesticide leaching concentrations were estimated for 162 sample sites on a 47 ha field. The procedure was repeated for different scenarios describing different patterns of spatial variation of degradation half-lives and the partition coefficient to soil organic carbon. To account for interpolation uncertainty, maps of predicted pesticide leaching risk were produced by the method of sequential Gaussian simulation. The results of the case study show that larger reductions of predicted leaching were achieved by site-specific application than by that of a comparable uniform dose reduction. Hence, site-specific-applications may be a feasible method to reduce pesticide leaching at the field-scale providing that the model approach gives reasonable estimates of the spatial pattern of pesticide leaching. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {High concentrations (20-75 mu mol cm(-3)) of amorphous Fe(III) oxide were observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus effusus rhizosphere sediments of a freshwater wetland in the southeastern United States. Incubation experiments demonstrated that microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction suppressed sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in surface sediments and mediated greater than or equal to 40{\%} of depth-integrated (0-10 cm) unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism, compared to less than or equal to 10{\%} for sulfate reduction. In situ CO2 and CH4 flux measurements verified that nonmethanogenic pathways accounted for similar to 50{\%} of unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism. Lower (similar to 10-fold) rates of dark/anaerobic CH4 flux from experimental vegetated cores relative to unvegetated controls suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited in the Juncus rhizosphere, in which active Fe(III) oxide reduction was indicated by the presence of low but readily detectable levels of dissolved and solid-phase Fe(II). Fe(III) oxide reduction accounted for 65{\%} of total carbon metabolism in rhizosphere sediment incubations, compared to 22{\%} for methanogenesis. In contrast, methanogenesis dominated carbon metabolism (72{\%} of total) in experimental unvegetated sediment cores. The high Fe(III) oxide concentrations and reduction rates observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus rhizosphere sediments were perpetuated by rapid Fe(III) regeneration via oxidation of Fe(II) compounds coupled to O2 input from the overlying water and plant roots, respectively. The results indicate that Fe(III) oxide reduction could mediate a considerable amount of organic carbon oxidation and significantly suppress CH4 production in freshwater wetlands situated within globally extensive iron-rich tropical and subtropical soil regimes.},

Isotope data can support the identification of nitrate pollution sources and natural attenuation processes of nitrate. REVIEW: This review article gives an overview of the information available to date regarding nitrate source apportionment in surface waters with the ambition to help improving future studies. Different isotope approaches in combination with physicochemical and hydrological data can successfully be used in source apportionment studies. A sampling strategy needs to be developed based on possible nitrate sources, hydrology and land use. Transformations, transport and mixing processes should also be considered as they can change the isotope composition of the original nitrate source. CONCLUSION: Nitrate isotope data interpreted in combination with hydrological and chemical data provide valuable information on the nitrate pollution sources and on the processes nitrate has undergone during its retention and transport in the watershed. This information is useful for the development of an appropriate water management policy.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in combined carbon-chlorine compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA)to differentiate between contaminant sources and to assess transformation processes. However, the significant abundance of polychlorinated molecules with several heavy chlorine isotopes complicates the evaluation of chlorine isotope trends. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a conceptual and mathematical framework that describes the expected chlorine isotope fractionation patterns during multistep transformation of chlorinated compounds. Reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes served as an example. The study demonstrates that chlorine isotope trends can be simulated by reproducing the average behavior of light and heavy isotopes or by explicitly simulating molecules with different numbers of heavy isotopes (isotopologues). The calculations reveal that initial chlorine isotope ratios of products equal the isotope ratios of their parent compounds in the absence of secondary isotope effects, while steadily increasing during transformation. The slopes in dual isotope plots are linear for reactant and product during a one-step reaction. They become nonlinear for products that are degraded further but converge to characteristic slopes. Consideration of different scenarios reveals that combined carbon-chlorine isotope analysis bears high potential to differentiate between contaminant sources, to elucidate reaction mechanisms in laboratory studies, and to identify transformation processes in the field.},

abstract = {Bacteriogenic iron oxides in natural environments are characterized by an abundance of ferrihydrite precipitates intermixed with bacterial structures that commonly resemble those produced by the lithoautotrophic microorganisms Gallionella ferruginea and Leptohtrix ochracea. These species have been inferred to play a causal role in the formation of bacteriogenic iron oxides, providing a pathway for the reduction of CO2 and the depletion of 13C in the organic constituents of bacteriogenic iron oxides. In this study, stable carbon isotope fractionation was determined for bacteriogenic iron oxide samples collected from submarine hydrothermal vents (Axial Volcano, Juan de Fuca Ridge), subterranean ({\"{A}}sp{\"{o}} Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden) and surficial (Chalk River, Canada) groundwater seeps, and cultures of G. ferruginea. Data were also collected from ferrihydrite samples lacking evidence of bacteria from Bounty Seamount in the vicinity of Pitcairn Island. The mean $\delta$13C of ferrihydrite was determined to be 15.87 4.96 for the samples from Axial Volcano, 24.97 0.43 for {\"{A}}sp{\"{o}}, 27.80 0.85 for Chalk River, 29.3 0.2 for the microbial culture, and 8.43 1.89 for the samples from Pitcairn. Samples with the highest concentration of organic carbon also had the lightest $\delta$13C in a logarithmic relationship. The consistency of carbon isotope values in relation to the presence of iron-oxidizing bacteria from natural and laboratory samples is interpreted as the ability of these microorganisms to fractionate carbon. The potential of this fractionation to serve as a biosignature holds promise when the resistance of carbon and bacteriogenic ferrihydrite to diagenesis is taken into consideration.},

Degradation experiments with gamma-HCH in concentrations of 22-25 mu M were carried out using benzoate (for D. multivorans) and lactate (for D. gigas) as electron donors, respectively. gamma-HCH was dechlorinated by both bacterial strains within four weeks, and the metabolites gamma-3,4,5,6-tetrachlorocyclohexene (gamma-TCCH), chlorobenzene (CB), and benzene were formed. The carbon isotope fractionation of gamma-HCH dechlorination was quantified by the Rayleigh model, using a bulk enrichment factor (epsilon C) of -3.9 +/- 0.6 for D. gigas and -3.4 +/- 0.5 for D. multivorans, which correspond to apparent kinetic isotope effect (AKIE(c)) values of 1.023 +/- 0.004 or 1.02 +/- 0.003 for stepwise Cl-C bond cleavage. The extent and range of isotope fractionation suggest that gamma-HCH dechlorination can be monitored in anoxic environments by compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA).},

To measure the history of net SOC accumulation there, we analyzed the upper 40 m of an ice core from Austfonna, the largest ice cap in Eurasia, for several legacy organochlorine (OC) compounds and current-use pesticides (CUPs) including organophosphorus (OP), triazine, dinitroaniline, and chloroacetamide compounds. Five OP compounds (chlorpyrifos, terbufos, diazinon, methyl parathion, and fenitrothion), two OCs (methoxychlor and dieldrin), and metolachlor--an herbicide--had historical profiles in the core. The highest OC concentration observed was aldrin (69.0 ng L(-1)) in the surface sample (1992-1998). The most concentrated OP was dimethoate (87.0 ng L(-1)) between 1986 and 1992. The surface sample also had highest concentrations of pendimethalin (herbicide, 18.6 ng L(-1)) and flutriafol, the lone observed fungicide (9.6 ng L(-1)). The apparent atmospheric persistence of CUPs likely results from little or no oxidation by OH* during the dark polar winter and in spring. Long-range atmospheric pesticide transport to Svalbard from Eurasia is influenced by the positive state of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index since 1980 and also by occasional fast-moving summer air masses from northern Eurasian croplands.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional mathematical model, termed a transport rate-based model, is developed for solute transport over infiltrating soil slopes under constant rainfall and declining sources. The model is comprised of (1) the kinematic-wave equation for overland flow, (2) a transport rate-based advection equation for overland solute transport, (3) a moment-based method for estimation of the parameters involved in the flow and solute transport equations, and (4) a semi-Lagrangian algorithm for numerical solution of the solute transport equation. Data from a single soil flume experiment under constant rainfall established the proof-of-concept for this new model. Sodium chloride was applied to the soil surface to simulate the presence of a declining diffuse pollutant. The parameters involved in the flow equation were found to take on the values that correspond to turbulent flow. With these turbulent flow parameters the simulated hydrograph displayed an initial rising limb, followed by a constant flow discharge. The profile of solute concentration exhibits a steep receding limb transitioning into an elongated tail. The solute transport rate follows a non-Gaussian distribution that does not appear to have been derived before. These theoretical hydrographs and pollutographs are in good agreement with those measured in laboratory, demonstrating the laboratory proof-of-concept for the transport rate-based model on soil and pavement blocks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The design, operation, pollutant removal as well as hydraulic modeling of wetland systems for wastewater treatment can be improved by better understanding and simulating the evapotranspiration process. To this purpose, two experiments were carried out in Northern (Veneto region) and Southern (Sicily region) Italy to measure evapotranspiration (ET) and determine the crop coefficient of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. using the FAO 56 approach. The experimental set-up consisted of a combination of vegetated and unvegetated plastic tanks (Veneto) or pilot sub-surface flow beds (Sicily). The ET values were obtained by measuring the amount of water needed to restore the initial volume in the tanks and in the beds after a certain period. All the needed climatic variables were measured and taken into account in the ET measurements. In the two experimental sites cumulative reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was similar to the cumulative ET measured in the control tanks and beds (without vegetation, ETcon), while ET measured for P. australis (ETphr) was significantly higher, underlining the strong effect of vegetation. From June 2009 to September 2009 the cumulative ET0, ETcon and ETphr in Veneto were 455, 424 and 3048mm, in Sicily 653, 556 and 3899mm, respectively. The plant coefficient trend of P. australis (Kp) estimated in Veneto was similar to that in Sicily, suggesting that the role of the plant in dispersing water is similar under different environmental conditions. Additional measurements made in the Veneto plant showed that Kp assumes different patterns and values in relation to plant age and growth stage. These results highlight the importance of the plants in regulating water losses from a wetland system, above all from small-scale constructed wetlands where the effect of the advection in ET rates is evident. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Carbon isotope fractionation during dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes was investigated using a methanogenic microbial enrichment culture. Subcultures were amended with trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC), respectively. Carbon isotope ratios and concentrations of reactants and of all dechlorination products were monitored during two experiments. All dechlorination steps were accompanied by significant isotope fractionation. The isotope ratios of the reactants were described with a Rayleigh type model, and the following enrichment factors ($\epsilon$P/R) were obtained: ?6.6 and ?2.5? for dechlorination of TCE, ?14.1 and ?16.1? for dechlorination of cis-DCE, and ?26.6 and ?21.5? for dechlorination of VC. Isotope and mass balances suggested that ethene (ETH) was degraded. In additional experiments with ETH as reactant, ETH became enriched in 13C as its concentration decreased indicating the cultures were capable of degrading ETH. The average value for the enrichment factor obtained for the degradation of ETH was ?3.0?. The large carbon isotope fractionation observed in this study confirms that carbon isotope ratios are a sensitive tool for monitoring dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes to nontoxic end products.},

abstract = {Sugarcane is an important crop for sugar and biofuel production in Brazil. Growers depend greatly on herbicides to produce it. This experiment used herbicide physical-chemical and sugarcane plant physiological properties to simulate herbicide uptake and estimate the bioconcentration factor (BCF). The (BCF) was calculated for the steady state chemical equilibrium between the plant herbicide concentration and soil solution. Plantwater partition coefficient (sugarcane bagasse-water partition coefficient), herbicide dilution rate, metabolism and dissipation in the soil-plant system, as well as total plant biomass factors were used. In addition, we added Tebuthiuron at rate of 5.0kg a.i. ha-1 to physically test the model. In conclusion, the model showed the following ranking of herbicide uptake: sulfentrazone {\textgreater} picloram {\textgreater}tebuthiuron {\textgreater} hexazinone {\textgreater} metribuzin {\textgreater} simazine {\textgreater} ametryn {\textgreater} diuron {\textgreater} clomazone {\textgreater} acetochlor. Furthermore, the highest BCF herbicides showed higher Groundwater Ubiquity Score (GUS) index indicating high leaching potential. We did not find tebuthiuron in plants after three months of herbicide application.},

abstract = {Anaerobic degradation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) was studied in microcosms derived from a laboratory-scale upflow treatment wetland system used to biodegrade chlorinated compounds present in groundwater from a Superfund site. Dechlorination kinetics of cis-1,2-DCE (0.94-1.57 d(-1)) and 1,2-DCA (0.15-0.71 d(-1)) were rapid, and degradation proceeded to completion with ethene or ethane as terminal dechlorination products. Hydrogen concentrations, measured simultaneously during dechlorination, were significantly different for the two compounds, approximately 2.5 nM for cis-1,2-DCE and 38 nM for 1,2-DCA. Methanogenesis proceeded during the degradation of 1,2-DCA when H2 concentrations were high but not during the dechlorination of cis-1,2-DCE when H2 concentrations were below published thresholds for methanogenesis. A 16S rRNA gene-based approach indicates that microorganisms closely related to Dehalococcoides ethenogenes were present and that they were distributed throughout the bottom, middle, and top of the upflow treatment wetland system. These results coupled with consideration of hydrogen thresholds, degradation kinetics, daughter products, and measurements of methanogenesis strongly suggest that halorespirers were responsible for dechlorination of cis-1,2-DCE and that 1,2-DCA dechlorination was co-metabolic, likely mediated by acetogens or methanogens. Rapid dechlorination potential was distributed throughout the wetland bed, both within and below the rhizosphere, indicating that reductive dechlorination pathways can be active in anaerobic environments located in close spatial proximity to aerobic environments and plants in treatment wetland systems.},

abstract = {In this study, a new technique for three-dimensional imaging of biofilm within porous media using X-ray computed microtomography is presented. Due to the similarity in X-ray absorption coefficients for the porous media (plastic), biofilm and aqueous phase, an X-ray contrast agent is required to image biofilm within the experimental matrix using X-ray computed tomography. The presented technique utilizes a medical suspension of barium sulphate to differentiate between the aqueous phase and the biofilm. Potassium iodide is added to the suspension to aid in delineation between the biofilm and the experimental porous medium. The iodide readily diffuses into the biofilm while the barium sulphate suspension remains in the aqueous phase. This allows for effective differentiation of the three phases within the experimental systems utilized in this study. The behaviour of the two contrast agents, in particular of the barium sulphate, is addressed by comparing two-dimensional images of biofilm within a pore network obtained by (1) optical visualization and (2) X-ray absorption radiography. We show that the contrast mixture provides contrast between the biofilm, the aqueous-phase and the solid-phase (beads). The imaging method is then applied to two three-dimensional packed-bead columns within which biofilm was grown. Examples of reconstructed images are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. Limitations and applications of the technique are discussed. A key benefit, associated with the presented method, is that it captures a substantial amount of information regarding the topology of the pore-scale transport processes. For example, the quantification of changes in porous media effective parameters, such as dispersion or permeability, induced by biofilm growth, is possible using specific upscaling techniques and numerical analysis. We emphasize that the results presented here serve as a first test of this novel approach; issues with accurate segmentation of the images, optimal concentrations of contrast agents and the potential need for use of synchrotron radiation sources need to be addressed before the method can be used for precise quantitative analysis of biofilm geometry in porous media.},

abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) enables quantification of biodegradation by use of the Rayleigh equation. The Rayleigh equation fails, however, to describe the sequential degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) involving various intermediates that are controlled by simultaneous degradation and production. This paper shows how isotope fractionation during sequential degradation can be simulated in a 1D reactive transport code (PHREEQC-2). 12C and 13C isotopes of each CAH were simulated as separate species, and the ratio of the rate constants of the heavy to light isotope equaled the kinetic isotope fractionation factor for each degradation step. The developed multistep isotope fractionation reactive transport model (IF-RTM) adequately simulated reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) to ethene in a microcosm experiment. Transport scenarios were performed to evaluate the effect of sorption and of different degradation rate constant ratios among CAH species on the downgradient isotope evolution. The power of the model to quantify degradation is illustrated for situations where mixed sources degrade and for situations where daughter products are removed by oxidative processes. Finally, the model was used to interpret the occurrence of reductive dechlorination at a field site. The developed methodology can easily be incorporated in 3D solute transport models to enable quantification of sequential CAH degradation in the field by CSIA.},

abstract = {Vertical flow filters are containers filled with porous medium that are recharged from top and drained at the bottom, and are operated at partly saturated conditions. They have recently been suggested as treatment technology for groundwater containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Numerical reactive transport simulations were performed to investigate the relevance of different filter operation modes on biodegradation and/or volatilization of the contaminants and to evaluate the potential limitation of such remediation mean due to volatile emissions. On the basis of the data from a pilot-scale vertical flow filter intermittently fed with domestic waste water, model predictions on the system's performance for the treatment of contaminated groundwater were derived. These simulations considered the transport and aerobic degradation of ammonium and two VOCs, benzene and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). In addition, the advective-diffusive gas-phase transport of volatile compounds as well as oxygen was simulated. Model predictions addressed the influence of depth and frequency of the intermittent groundwater injection, degradation rate kinetics, and the composition of the filter material. Simulation results show that for unfavorable operation conditions significant VOC emissions have to be considered and that operation modes limiting VOC emissions may limit aerobic biodegradation. However, a suitable combination of injection depth and composition of the filter material does facilitate high biodegradation rates while only little VOC emissions take place. Using such optimized operation modes would allow using vertical flow filter systems as remediation technology suitable for groundwater contaminated with volatile compounds.},

After 56-day incubation, the residual concentrations of pyrethroids in unsterilized soil were much lower than those in sterilized soil, indicating that microbial degradation was dominant for the elimination of pyrethroids. Meanwhile, the stable carbon isotope ratios of the six pyrethroids were determined during the degradation. Significant stable carbon isotope fractionation was observed during the microbial degradation of fenpropathrin, $\alpha$-cypermethrin and deltamethrinhe. The enrichment factor $\epsilon$ was determined as −1.88‰, −1.82‰ and −2.00‰, respectively. A new approach was then developed to estimate the bioavailability of the three pyrethroids by determining stable carbon isotope ratios.

abstract = {Carbon (C), chlorine (Cl), and hydrogen (H) isotope effects were determined during dechlorination of TCE to ethene by a mixed Dehalococcoides (Dhc) culture. The C isotope effects for the dechlorination steps were consistent with data published in the past for reductive dechlorination (RD) by Dhc. The Cl effects (combined with an inverse H effect in TCE) suggested that dechlorination proceeded through nucleophilic reactions with cobalamin rather than by an electron transfer mechanism. Depletions of (37)Cl in daughter compounds, resulting from fractionation at positions away from the dechlorination center (secondary isotope effects), further support the nucleophilic dechlorination mechanism. Determination of C and Cl isotope ratios of the reactants and products in the reductive dechlorination chain offers a potential tool for differentiation of Dhc activity from alternative transformation mechanisms (e.g., aerobic degradation and reductive dechlorination proceeding via outer sphere mechanisms), in studies of in situ attenuation of chlorinated ethenes. Hydrogenation of the reaction products (DCE, VC, and ethene) showed a major preference for the (1)H isotope. Detection of depleted dechlorination products could provide a line of evidence in discrimination between alternative sources of TCE (e.g., evolution from DNAPL sources or from conversion of PCE).},

abstract = {In the Netherlands, a spatially distributed version of the pesticide fate model PEARL is routinely used to assess the leaching potential of pesticides to groundwater. Recently, the model was modified to simulate the movement of pesticides to surface water. The peak concentration is considered to be the most important exposure endpoint for the ecotoxicological effect assessment for aquatic organisms. Macropore flow is an important driver for the peak concentration, so the leaching model PEARL was extended with a macropore module. Macropore parameters were derived from generally available soil data such as organic matter content and clay content using newly developed pedotransfer functions. These pedotransfer functions were constructed using a wide range of Dutch clayey soils. Results indicate a good correlation between these variables and soil structural parameters, which is due to the homogeneous mineralogical composition of Dutch clayey soils. Results of the spatially distributed modelling indicate that due to rapid transport through macropores, the concentration of pesticides in drainage water is generally higher in clayey soils than in light textured soils. In clayey soils, the boundary hydraulic conductivity and organic matter content were the most important drivers for the concentration in drainage water. Results further indicate that the concentration of pesticide in drainage water increases with increasing half-life and decreases with increasing sorption coefficient. However, the effect of these parameters is much less than obtained with the convection-dispersion equation because due to preferential flow most of the reactive part of the soil profile is bypassed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents has been documented at a number of field sites. Reductive dechlorination driven by co-contaminants or naturally occurring organics as substrates in combination with aerobic or co-metabolic degradation contains certain chlorinated solvent plumes.

abstract = {Clogging is a major operational and maintenance issue associated with the use of subsurface flow wetlands for wastewater treatment, and can ultimately limit the lifetime of the system. This review considers over two decades of accumulated knowledge regarding clogging in both vertical and horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands. The various physical, chemical and biological factors responsible for clogging are identified and discussed. The occurrence of clogging is placed into the context of various design and operational parameters such as wastewater characteristics, upstream treatment processes, intermittent or continuous operation, influent distribution, and media type. This information is then used to describe how clogging develops within, and subsequently impacts, common variants of subsurface flow treatment wetland typically used in the U.S., U.K., France and Germany. Comparison of these systems emphasized that both hydraulic loading rate and solids loading rate need to be considered when designing systems to operate robustly, i.e. hydraulic overloading makes horizontal-flow tertiary treatment systems in the U.K. more susceptible to clogging problems than vertical-flow primary treatment systems in France. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of clogging as they relate to the design, operation, and maintenance of subsurface flow treatment wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Field studies have shown that diffuse herbicide losses to surface waters often originate from a limited part of a catchment only. These critical source areas (CSA) are characterized by the occurrence of fast-flow processes like surface runoff or macropore flow to tile drains. Moreover, topographic barriers often interrupt the overland flow into the adjacent brook and lead to internal sink areas. From there artificial drains can create a shortcut to the stream network. We tested the predictability of CSA with a modified version of the hydrological Soil Moisture Distribution {\&} Routing model (SMDR). The study area was a small agricultural catchment in Switzerland, in which herbicide losses to surface waters had been experimentally investigated. The small-scale structures, relevant for surface connectivity, were derived using terrain analysis algorithms based on a high-resolution digital elevation map. The analysis showed that surface runoff from a large part (66{\%}) of the study area cannot reach the stream network. Based on prior parameter estimates, the simulated discharge agreed well with the measured values for spring 2000 (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.88). Surface saturation was mainly predicted for Gleysol areas, whereby topography was the main driver, and not soil properties. The spatial distribution of CSA and predicted runoff processes agreed well with measured herbicide losses. The main losses were predicted for connected areas prone to surface runoff; additional drained sinks (reinfiltration areas on unconnected areas) were identified as potential risk areas. The predictions are subject to substantial uncertainties. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the model is most sensitive to parameters describing the lower boundary of the soil (deep percolation and depth of the soil). The spatial extent and the efficiency of the drainage system are also crucial for the spatial variability of herbicide losses. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Clean-up of contaminated sites is usually based on a risk-based approach for the definition of the remediation goals, which relies on the well known ASTM-RBCA standard procedure. In this procedure, migration of contaminants is described through simple analytical models and the source contaminants' concentration is supposed to be constant throughout the entire exposure period, i.e. 25-30 years. The latter assumption may often result over-protective of human health, leading to unrealistically low remediation goals. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative model taking in account the source depletion, while keeping the original simplicity and analytical form of the ASTM-RBCA approach. The results obtained by the application of this model are compared with those provided by the traditional ASTM-RBCA approach, by a model based on the source depletion algorithm of the RBCA ToolKit software and by a numerical model, allowing to assess its feasibility for inclusion in risk analysis procedures. The results discussed in this work are limited to on-site exposure to contaminated water by ingestion, but the approach proposed can be extended to other exposure pathways. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Aging is, like deposition, often sensitive to temperature, so that heat transfer, deposition, and aging are coupled phenomena. Ishiyama et al. (AIChE J. 2010;56:531–545) presented a distributed model of the aging of deposits formed by chemical reaction fouling and illustrated its effect on thermal and hydraulic performance of a HTD operating in the turbulent flow regime. Two-layer models, simpler than the distributed model, are explored. The deposit is considered to consist of two layers, fresh and aged; this simple picture is shown to be sufficient to interpret thermal and hydraulic aspects of deposit aging when HTDs are operated at constant heat flux (as reflecting laboratory experiments) but not in cases where the constant wall temperature approximation is more realistic.},

Simulation models are effective tools for predicting pollutant loads from overland flow to surface water. In this study, we reviewed and summarized experimental observations to assess the factors that affect this transfer process, including: rainfall, topography, soil hydraulic properties, initial water and solute conditions, and management practices. Theoretical frameworks and models for describing the transfer process were also reviewed. The existing models were classified into four categories based on their principles: mixing-layer models, interfacial diffusion-controlled models, interfacial-diffusion and rainfall-dispersion models, and empirical models. The assumptions, parameters, applications, limitations or potential issues, and further improvements for each category of the models were discussed. It is recommended that new experimental methods be developed and current theoretical frameworks be further refined by considering the effects of other environmental factors and transport mechanisms on solute transfer from the soil surface to overland flow so that the models can be applied to a wider range of practical field conditions.},

abstract = {Concentration – discharge (c-q) hysteresis loops are used to qualitatively understand solute transport pathways to streams. The majority of c-q studies involve non-urban areas in environmental settings such as the subtropics, mountains, and high latitude rivers. Only a few involve urban or urban salted watersheds. In this study, we explore c-q hysteresis plots and pollutographs for a variety of inorganic solutes (Cl−, Na+, K+, SiO2, NO3−), dissolved organic carbon and an indicator of the aromatic fraction (SUVA254), and a microbiological indicator (E. coli) in an urban salted watershed. The major hydrologic events are snow melts. The overarching hypothesis is that the hysteresis behavior can be explained by extending the pathway analysis (i.e., relative importance of storm event water, CSE; groundwater CG; and soil water, CSO) from the Evans-Davis classification scheme that describes six behaviors to account for differences in source locations and the biogeochemical behavior of the solutes along these pathways. Data sets for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were assembled from a series of undergraduate and graduate research projects performed over this period. The results of these studies indicate that: 1) Cl− and Na+ exhibit a combination of C2 (CSE {\textgreater} CSO {\textgreater} CG) and C3 (CG {\textgreater} CSE {\textgreater} CSO) behavior during salting season and A1 (CSO {\textgreater} GG {\textgreater} CSE) and A2 (CSO {\textgreater} CSE {\textgreater} CG) behavior in non-salting times; 2) SiO2 shows A3 (CG {\textgreater} CSO {\textgreater} CSE) behavior in all events, 3) K+ changes from C2 to C1 (CSE {\textgreater} CG {\textgreater} CSO) with concentration depletion over subsequent events; 4) NO3− changes from A2 to C1 or C2 with concentration depletion over subsequent events; 5) DOC and SUVA254 exhibit C2 and A1 behavior, respectively; 6) E. coli changes from C2 to A2 over subsequent storms; 7) Cl−and Na+ peak before the rising limb with a slight lag in the Na+ peak and 8) E. coli does not exhibit first-flush behavior. An integrative pollutograph for a snow melt event shows, 1) K+ and DOC peak together three times, unrelated to any additional event such as rain; 2) DOC becomes more aliphatic at its first peak, and 3) NO3− has a concentration decrease at the second DOC/K+ peak and peaks on the declining limb after the third DOC/K+ peak. These observations can be explained in terms of the c-q plots (e.g., importance of event water), environmental behavior (e.g., conservative solute), the nature of the urban landscape (e.g., pavement), and season (e.g., damped microbial activity). We interpret the multiple concentration peaks to indicate water masses originating from different compartments in the watershed are reaching the stream at different times and with different chemistries. These results extend the work of previous studies and may serve to help develop a fingerprint of solute behavior that can be used to more fully explore early season biogeochemical dynamics in an urban, salted, snow-melt dominated watershed.},

Hydrological processes, including water residence times, were analyzed using a 2D depth-averaged flow model and the denitrifier community structure was analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoreses (DGGE) of nosZ genes, encoding nitrous oxide reductase. In addition, we provide a theoretical basis for evaluation of denitrification rates useful in nitrate-limited conditions. The results demonstrate that potential denitrification rates differed significantly between the sampling locations (CV=0.34). The variations were best described by concentration of nitrogen in sediments and water residence time. DGGE analyses indicated that a few key populations dominated and that the community diversity increased with decreasing nutrient levels and increasing water residence times. Moreover, we found that denitrification rates in terms of Menten and first-order kinetics can be evaluated by fitting a mathematical expression, comparing denitrification and other nitrogen-transforming processes to measured product formation in nitrate-limited experiments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wetlands are reactive zones of the landscape that can sequester metals released by industrial and agricultural activities. Copper (Cu) stable isotope ratios ($\delta$(65)Cu) have recently been used as tracers of transport and transformation processes in polluted environments. Here, we used Cu stable isotopes to trace the behavior of Cu in a stormwater wetland receiving runoff from a vineyard catchment (Alsace, France). The Cu loads and stable isotope ratios were determined in the dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter (SPM), wetland sediments, and vegetation. The wetland retained {\textgreater}68{\%} of the dissolved Cu and {\textgreater}92{\%} of the SPM-bound Cu, which represented 84.4{\%} of the total Cu in the runoff. The dissolved Cu became depleted in (65)Cu when passing through the wetland ($\Delta$(65)Cuinlet-outlet from 0.03‰ to 0.77‰), which reflects Cu adsorption to aluminum minerals and organic matter. The $\delta$(65)Cu values varied little in the wetland sediments (0.04 ± 0.10‰), which stored {\textgreater}96{\%} of the total Cu mass within the wetland. During high-flow conditions, the Cu flowing out of the wetland became isotopically lighter, indicating the mobilization of reduced Cu(I) species from the sediments and Cu reduction within the sediments. Our results demonstrate that the Cu stable isotope ratios may help trace Cu behavior in redox-dynamic environments such as wetlands.},

abstract = {Stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) of contaminants is an emerging technique to characterize in situ microbial activity. The kinetic isotope effect in microbial degradation reactions, or enzyme catalysis, is caused by the preferential cleavage of bonds containing light rather than heavy isotopes. This leads to a relative enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the residual substrate pool. However, a number of nonisotopically sensitive steps preceding the isotopically sensitive bond cleavage may affect the reaction kinetics of a degradation process, thus reducing the observed (i.e., the macroscopically detectable) isotope fractionation. Low bioavailability of contaminants poses kinetic limitations on the biodegradation process and can significantly reduce the observed kinetic isotope fractionation. Here we present experimental evidence for the influence of bioavailability-limited pollutant biodegradation on observed stable isotope fractionation. Batch laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the toluene hydrogen isotope fractionation of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (pWWO) subjected to different small concentrations of toluene with and without deuterium label, which corresponded to realistic environmental mass transfer scenarios. Detected isotope fractionations depended significantly on the toluene concentration, hence confirming the influence of substrate mass transfer limitation on observed isotope fractionation, hypothesized by Thullner et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42,6544-6551). Our results indicate that the bioavailability of a substrate should be considered during quantitative analysis of microbial degradation based on SIFA.},

abstract = {The effect of sorption on degradation of the pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was studied in a soil amended with various amounts of activated carbon (AC). The relationship between sorption and decay of 2,4-D was analyzed using analytical solutions for equilibrium sorption and to a two-site nonequilibrium adsorption model coupled with two first-order degradation terms for the dissolved and sorbed pesticide, respectively. The sorption parameters in the latter model were determined based on data obtained from batch sorption experiments, while those for degradation were obtained from incubation experiments. The adsorption coefficients, ranging from 0.811 to {\textgreater}315 ml g-1, increased at higher AC, and were negatively related to degradation as measured by the first-order rate constant, implying that degradation is faster from the liquid phase than from the sorbed phase. A nonlinear fit of the decay curves to the nonequilibrium model revealed that degradation rate constants were 0.157 and 0.00243 day-1 for the liquid and sorbed phases, respectively, differing by a factor of 65. Similar results were also obtained using the equilibrium model. A parameter sensitivity analysis of the nonequilibrium model indicates that nonequilibrium sorption will initially favor degradation; however, over the long term, will decrease degradation when desorption kinetics becomes the limiting factor in the degradation process. In the presence of a lag phase that allows appreciable amounts of chemical to diffuse into kinetic sorption sites, nonequilibrium sorption will only impede degradation.

abstract = {Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) is widely utilized to study the fate of organic contaminants in groundwater. To date, however, no method is available to obtain CSIA samples at a fine (cm) spatial scale across the sediment?surface water interface (SWI), a key boundary for discharge of contaminated groundwater to surface water. Dissolved contaminants in such discharged zones undergo rapid temporal and spatial changes due to heterogeneity in redox conditions and microbial populations. The compatibility of a passive sediment pore water sampler (?peeper?) to collect 40 mL samples for CSIA of benzene, toluene, monochlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at field-relevant concentrations (0.1?5 mg L?1) was evaluated in laboratory experiments. Results demonstrate that physical diffusion across the polysulfone membrane does not alter the carbon isotope values (±0.5?). Measured $\delta$13C values also remain invariant despite significant adsorption of the compounds on the peeper material, an effect which increased with higher numbers of chlorine atoms and sorption coefficient (Koc) values. In addition, isotope equilibrium between the peeper chamber and the sediment pore water occurred in less than a day, indicating the peeper method can be used to provide samples for CSIA analysis at fine spatial and temporal sampling resolutions in contaminated sediments.},

Three new topological indices derived from the electrotopological state indices of Kier and Hall were proposed.

abstract = {Missing values in datasets are a well-known problem and there are quite a lot of R packages offering imputation functions. But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.},

abstract = {Abstract Pesticides are typically applied as mixtures and or sequentially to soil and plants during crop production. A common scenario is herbicide application at planting followed by sequential fungicide applications post-emergence. Fungicides depending on their spectrum of activity may alter and impact soil microbial communities. Thus there is a potential to impact soil processes responsible for herbicide degradation. This may change herbicide efficacy and environmental fate characteristics. Our study objective was to determine the effects of 4 peanut fungicides, chlorothalonil (2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,3-benzenedicarbonitrile), tebuconazole ($\alpha$-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-$\alpha$-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol), flutriafol ($\alpha$-(2-fluorophenyl)-$\alpha$-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol), and cyproconazole ($\alpha$-(4-chlorophenyl)-$\alpha$-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) on the dissipation kinetics of the herbicide, metolachlor (2-chloro-N-(6-ethyl-o-tolyl)-N-[(1RS)-2-methoxy-1-methylethyl]acetamide), and on the soil microbial community. This was done through laboratory incubation of field treated soil. Chlorothalonil significantly reduced metolachlor soil dissipation as compared to the non-treated control or soil treated with the other fungicides. Metolachlor DT50 was 99days for chlorothalonil-treated soil and 56, 45, 53, and 46days for control, tebuconazole, flutriafol, and cyproconazole-treated soils, respectively. Significant reductions in predominant metolachlor metabolites, metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid (MESA) and metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOA), produced by oxidation of glutathione-metolachlor conjugates were also observed in chlorothalonil-treated soil. This suggested that the fungicide impacted soil glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. Fungicide DT50 was 27–80days but impacts on the soil microbial community as indicated by lipid biomarker analysis were minimal. Overall study results indicated that chlorothalonil has the potential to substantially increase soil persistence (2-fold) of metolachlor and alter fate and transport processes. GST mediated metabolism is common pesticide detoxification process in soil; thus there are implications for the fate of many active ingredients.},

abstract = {Many simplifications are used in modeling surface runoff over a uniform slope A very common simplification is to determine the infiltration rate independent of the overland flow depth and to combine it afterward with the kinematic-wave equation to determine the overland flow depth. Another simplification is to replace the spatially variable infiltration rates along the slope i(x, t) due to the water depth variations h(x, t) with an infiltration rate that is determined at a certain location along the slope. The aim of this study is to evaluate the errors induced by these simplifications on predicted infiltration rates, overland flow depths, and total runoff volume. The error analysis the accomplished by comparing a simplified model with a model where the interaction between the over and flow depth and infiltration rate is counted. In this model the infiltration rate is assumed to vary along the slope with the overland flow depth even for homogeneous soil profiles. The kinematic-wave equation with interactive infiltration rate, calculated along the slope by Richard's equation, are then solved by a finite difference scheme for a 100-m-long uniform slope. In the first error analysis, we study the effect of combining an 'exact' and 'approximate' one-dimensional infiltration rate with the kinematic-wave equation for three different soil surface roughness coefficients. The terms 'exact' and 'approximate' stand for the solution of Richard's equation with and without using the overland flow depth, in the boundary condition, respectively. The simulations showed that higher infiltration rates and lower overland/low depths are obtained during the rising stage of the hydrograph when overland flow depth is used in the upper boundary condition of the one-dimensional Richard's equation. During the recession period, the simplified model predicts lower infiltration rates and higher overland flow depths. The absolute relative errors between the 'exact' and 'approximate' solutions are positively correlated to the overland flow depths which increase with the soil surface roughness coefficient. For this error analysis the relative errors in surface runoff volume per unit slope width throughout the storm are much smaller their the relative errors in momentary overland flow depths and discharges due to the alternate signs of the deviations along the rising and falling stages. In the second error analysis, when the spatially variable infiltration rate along the slope i(x, t) is replaced in the kinematic-wave equation by i(t), calculated at the slope outlet, the overland flow depth is underestimated during the rising stage of the hydrograph and overestimated during the falling stage. The deviations during the rising stage are much smaller than the deviations during the falling stage, but they are of a longer duration. This occurs because the solution with i(x, t) recognizes that part of the slope becomes dry after rainfall stops, while overland flow still exists with i(t) determined at the slope outlet. As obtained for the first error analysis, the relative errors in surface runoff volume per unit slope width are also much smaller than the relative errors in momentary overland flow depths and discharges. The relation between the errors in overland flow depth and discharge to different mathematical simplifications enables to evaluate whether certain simplifications are justified or more computational efforts should be used.},

Rhizodeposition was found to advance the biodegradation of 4-chlorophenol when using a mixed bacterial culture and pure cultures of bacteria previously isolated from Phalaris arundinacea roots. This stimulation is a result of rhizodeposition products serving as growth substrates for the bacteria. Investigations with Ralstonia eutropha (DSMZ Braunschweig, strain 5536) confirmed the function of rhizodeposition products as growth substrates. Degradation by Acinetobacter baumannii and Ralstonia sp. obtained from Phalaris arundinacea was accompanied by the dechlorination of 4-chlorophenol.

Because it is difficult to characterize these two variables, we have studied the stability of empirical relations between L and C. Ground cover was measured from vertical-view photographs. For both maize (Zea mays L, var Dea) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris, var Matador), we found the extinction coefficient (K) to be robust throughout crop development and only weakly affected by population density and sowing geometry. Thus, measurement of C appears to be a simple way to estimate L, once the relation has been established for the variety of interest, and excluding periods of water stress that may modify crop geometry.},

Hydrochemical parameters and oxygen concentration were major drivers of bacterial composition, whereas exposure to chloroacetanilides had no detectable impact. Taken together, the results underline the importance of anaerobic degradation of chloroacetanilides in wetlands, and highlight the potential of complementary chemical and biological approaches to characterise processes involved in the environmental dissipation of chloroacetanilides.},

PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of water samples obtained from different parts of the wetland revealed that changes of the bacterial community structure coincided with a succession of the hydrochemical conditions in the wetland, from oxic towards anoxic conditions. During this transition phase, the appearance of vinyl chloride and ethene correlated with the presence of putative dechlorinating bacteria (Dehalococcoides spp., Geobacter spp. and Dehalobacter spp.). Additionally, a shift of the DCE isotopic composition indicated the progressive prevalence of reductive dechlorination in the wetland. Although the DCE degradation processes varied over time, biodegradation activity was maintained in the wetland system. 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that Proteobacteria accounted for {\textgreater}50{\%} of 16S rRNA genes clone libraries, whereas approximately 17{\%} of the sequences from the wetland were related to sulphate reducers. Based on a multiple-method approach, this study illustrates the linkage between microbial community dynamics and composition, changes of hydrochemical conditions and processes of DCE degradation in a wetland system.},

Samples from nested piezometers and porous-membrane sampling devices (peepers) showed that PCA concentrations decreased and that less chlorinated daughter products formed as the groundwater became increasingly reducing along upward flow paths through the wetland sediments. The cis and trans isomers of 1,2-dichloroethylene (12DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) were the predominant daughter products detected from degradation of PCA in the field and in microcosms constructed under methanogenic conditions. Significantly lower ratios of cis-12DCE to trans-12DCE were produced by PCA degradation than by degradation of trichloroethylene, a common co-contaminant with PCA. 1,1,2-Trichloroethane (112TCA) and 1,2-dichloroethane (12DCA) occurred simultaneously with 12DCE, indicating simultaneous hydrogenolysis and dichloroelimination of PCA. From an initial PCA concentration of about 1.5 mu mol/L, concentrations of PCA and its daughter products decreased to below detection within a 1.0-m vertical distance in the wetland sediments and within 34 days in the microcosms.

abstract = {A loss of marginal wetland acreage adjoining agricultural fields has created a potential problem with water quality enhancement of agricultural runoff via wetlands. Current research is investigating the utility of constructed wetlands for pesticide mitigation purposes, thereby restoring water quality enhancement capability to the area. Constructed wetland mesocosms (59-73 m × 14 m), located at the University of Mississippi Field Station (Lafayette County, MS), were amended with metolachlor to simulate a cropland runoff event. Target concentrations for wetlands were 73 and 147 $\mu$g/l metolachlor in addition to an unamended control (0 $\mu$g/l). Water, sediment, and plant samples were collected weekly for 35 days following metolachlor amendment. Samples were collected from sites, longitudinally distributed within each wetland, and analyzed for metolachlor using gas chromatography. Between 7 and 25{\%} of measured metolachlor mass was in the first 30-36 m (from inflow) of wetlands immediately following application and simulated rainfall. Approximately 10{\%} of measured metolachlor mass was in plant samples. Suggested wetland travel distances for effective mitigation of metolachlor runoff ranged from 100 to 400 m. According to the results from this research, aquatic receiving system impacts due to metolachlor runoff could be mitigated by using constructed wetlands as buffers. Landowners and government agencies can integrate this information into a water management plan, allowing for better control of both quantity and quality of runoff water from individual agricultural fields.

abstract = {Assessing the presence of pesticides in environmental waters is particularly challenging because of the huge number of substances used which may end up in the environment. Furthermore, the occurrence of pesticide transformation products (TPs) and/or metabolites makes this task even harder. Most studies dealing with the determination of pesticides in water include only a small number of analytes and in many cases no TPs. The present study applied a screening method for the determination of a large number of pesticides and TPs in wastewater (WW) and surface water (SW) from Spain and Italy. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to screen a database of 450 pesticides and TPs. Detection and identification were based on specific criteria, i.e. mass accuracy, fragmentation, and comparison of retention times when reference standards were available, or a retention time prediction model when standards were not available. Seventeen pesticides and TPs from different classes (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) were found in WW in Italy and Spain, and twelve in SW. Generally, in both countries more compounds were detected in effluent WW than in influent WW, and in SW than WW. This might be due to the analytical sensitivity in the different matrices, but also to the presence of multiple sources of pollution. HRMS proved a good screening tool to determine a large number of substances in water and identify some priority compounds for further quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {H2S acts as an oxidizing agent in natural systems and compares with molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor. The experimentally determined lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for H2S is −1.1 eV, which means that H2S can be an excellent electron acceptor. In the oxidation of Fe(II) monosulfide by H2S in aqueous solutions between 25 and 125°C, FeS+H2S(aq)=FeS2+H2(g) (where FeS is any Fe(II) monosulfide, H2S(aq) is aqueous H2S, FeS2 is pyrite and H2(g) is hydrogen gas), FeS is the electron donor (reductant) and aqueous H2S is the electron acceptor (oxidant) and the product of the oxidation is H2 gas. Because of the relative destabilization of H2S caused by the presence of an antibonding LUMO orbital in a significantly bent molecule, electrons added to this LUMO orbital cause a weakening of both SH bonds as an SS bond forms. This allows the hydrogen atoms to combine to form H2 because of their proximity and favorable interaction based on the original LUMO of H2S. The reaction is transport-controlled. The mean Arrhenius energy for the reaction is 33.7 kJ mol−1. The Arrhenius energy is temperature dependent, which is consistent with electroactive, colloidal FeS being the FeS reactant. MO calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds through a FeS → SH2 intermediate. The intermediate allows for the formation of an SS bond, the breaking of HS bonds with the formation of H2 and the conversion of Fe(II) from high to low spin. The H2 and FeS2 formed interact with adsorption of H2 onto the FeS2 surface. The reaction mechanism can be summarised 1.FeS(s)→FeS(aq)(fast{\textless}ca.100°C{\textgreater}slow)2.FeS(aq)+H2S(aq)→{\{}FeS→SH2{\}}(fast)3.{\{}FeS→SH2{\}}→[FeS2⋅H2(occluded)](fast)4.[FeS2⋅H2(occluded)]→FeS2(s)+H2(g)(slow{\textless}ca.100°C{\textgreater}fast) The product pyrite forms as mixtures of individual cubes (up to 800 nm in size) and sub-spherical aggregates up to 1400 nm in diameter (“protoframboids”) on the surface of aggregates of particulate FeS. The lack of crystal growth observed in the pyrite products through 20 days of reaction at 125°C suggests that growth is nutrient limited. Observations show that initially, pyrite nucleates on the FeS but subsequently nucleation occurs on pre-formed pyrite crystals. Nucleation is rapid and kinetically favored over crystal growth leading to no significant increase in crystal size as the reaction progresses. There is some evidence that the crystal growth mechanism is through screw dislocation growth. HS− cannot be an electron acceptor because of the high positive calculated energy for the LUMO orbital (+8.015 eV). It is not possible to write an electronically balanced redox reaction involving HS− with FeS without the presence of an additional electron acceptor. In contrast, it is possible at high pH values that the complex FeSH+ could react with HS− to form pyrite: however, the reaction is very slow and has not been observed experimentally. The net effect of these observations in natural systems is that reduced systems may change from oxidized to reduced merely by changing pH, from H2S-dominant (oxidizing) at pH {\textless} 7 to HS− dominant (reducing) at pH {\textgreater} 7.},

The results show significant VC and dichloroethene (DCE) mineralization under hypoxic conditions. All the sample treatments exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics for DCE and VC mineralization over an extended range of substrate concentrations. First-order rates for VC mineralization were approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher in hypoxic groundwater sediment treatments and at least three times higher in hypoxic surface water sediment treatments than in the respective anoxic treatments. For VC, oxygen-linked processes accounted for 65 to 85{\%} of mineralization at DO concentrations below 0.1 mg/L, and 14CO2 was the only degradation product observed in VC treatments under hypoxic conditions. Because the lower detection limit for DO concentrations measured in the field is typically 0.1 to 0.5 mg/L, these results indicate that oxygen-linked VC and DCE biodegradation can be significant under field conditions that appear anoxic. Furthermore, because rates of VC mineralization exceeded rates of DCE mineralization under hypoxic conditions, DCE accumulation without concomitant accumulation of VC may not be evidence of a DCE degradative “stall” in chloroethene plumes. Significantly, mineralization of VC above the level that could reasonably be attributed to residual DO contamination was also observed in several nominally anoxic (DO minimum detection limit = 0.01 mg/L) microcosm treatments.},

abstract = {The environmental significance of soil bound pesticide residues (SBPR) is potentially large because approximately one third of the applied mass of the pesticides in agriculture ends up as SBPR. At EU level, there is little regulatory guidance available on the environmental risk assessment of SBPR in spite of some 50 years of SBPR research. This lack of guidance is partially caused by the fact that the current definitions of SBPR are founded on non-extractability in soil in the laboratory whereas for the environmental risk assessment not the soil in the laboratory but the soil in the field is the system of interest. Therefore a definition of SBPR is proposed that is based on the field soil: a molecule (further called 'the mother molecule') is soil bound if a relevant part of this molecule has become part of the solid phase in the soil and if this relevant part will never be released again to the liquid phase in soil under relevant field conditions in the form of this mother molecule or in the form of another molecule that may possibly raise environmental or human toxicological concerns. This mother moleculemay be the parent substance that is applied to the soil but itmay also be a metabolite of this parent substance. A consequence of the definition is that the SBPR terminology becomes more precise because the mother molecule of the soil bound residue has to be specified. A further consequence is that very strong but reversible sorption of molecules such as paraquat is not considered soil-bound residue anymore (as may be demonstrated by a self-exchange extraction procedure). Furthermore, the definition requires that risk managers have to define what they consider as 'relevant field conditions' (e.g. include also changes of agricultural fields into forests?).},

abstract = {Rainfall results in the transfer of chemicals from soil to surface runoff. A physically-based solute transport model was developed for estimating the solute concentration in runoff originating from the soil surface. The model accounts for the effects of soil infiltration, raindrops, the water runoff rate, and the return flow, all of which influence the concentration of the solutes in the runoff. It was assumed that the depth of mixing zone changed with the varieties of the raindrop hits, return flow, and overland flow. It was also assumed that runoff and soil in the mixing zone mixed instantaneously and that the solute in the soil beneath the mixing zone was moved to the mixing zone by diffusion. The mixing zone was included in the model and was based on the deposited layer or shield concept. To test the model, laboratory experiments were carried out that used two soil types that were exposed to simulated rainfall. The results simulated by the model were highly correlated with the experimental data. In the first few minutes after rainfall began, the solute concentration in the runoff was mainly controlled by the rainfall rate and solute concentration in the mixing zone; higher solute levels in the mixing zone resulted in higher solute concentrations in runoff. When the solute concentration in the runoff stabilized, the solute concentration in the runoff was mainly controlled by the diffusion of solutes from the soil beneath the mixing zone. The simulated data showed a high level of correlation with the measured data for both runoff volume and solute concentration in the runoff. This demonstrates that the model captured the temporal behavior of the runoff and solute transport in the runoff. Read More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/{\%}28ASCE{\%}29HE.1943-5584.0000622},

As a consequence, modeling approaches simulating the fate of organics and related changes in redox conditions have to account for the effects of microbial activity on the degradation kinetics, as well as for the spatial and temporal distributions of the chemical species (e.g., terminal electron acceptors, nutrients or toxic substances) that control microbial activity. The present paper reviews the principal modeling approaches that are used to simulate the degradation of organic matter in water-saturated porous media. Special attention is devoted to modeling the bioavailability of chemical substrates of microbial reactions, and the sequential occurrence of terminal electron accepting pathways. While the various model approaches found in the literature are capable of reproducing field data sets from various environmental settings, they are rarely compared in terms of performance and predictive ability. Most approaches incorporate simplifications or empirical rate laws, which limit their range of application. Thus, there remains a need for further development of more general, process-based modeling concepts to represent microbially mediated reactive processes.},

abstract = {This work presents analytical models which are able to predict contours of concentrations and isotope ratios of organic pollutants in homogeneous aquifers. Four analytical solutions of the advective-dispersive transport equation for reactive transport from the literature differing in assumptions regarding biodegradation kinetics were used. Stable isotope ratios are computed after modelling the individual reactive transport of isotopic species in the aquifer, which respond differently to fractionation by biodegradation or sorption. The main finding of this study is that the isotope ratios in the plumes are very sensitive to the assumptions underlying the biodegradation kinetics in the models. When biodegradation occurs throughout the core of the plume as first-order reaction, the transversal gradients in isotope ratios are smooth. When biodegradation occurs in a bi-molecular reaction with an electron acceptor (modelled by double-Monod kinetics), steep transversal isotope gradients are predicted. When the reaction rates approach instantaneous reaction along the plume fringes, isotope shifts in the core of the plume disappear. A model incorporating plume and fringe degradation produces the most plausible predictions of isotope ratios in this study. It is shown furthermore that isotope fractionation by sorption causes an even different pattern of isotope ratios, with positive shifts restricted to near the forerunning front of an expanding plume. The models developed in this work can serve for the validation of numerical models and may be incorporated in natural attenuation support systems such as e.g. BIOSCREEN. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Compound-specific H isotope analysis has been used to monitor bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons. However, the success of this approach requires a full evaluation of the isotopic effects resulting from evaporation, because light petroleum hydrocarbons undergo both biodegradation and evaporation under natural conditions. The authors determined the H isotope fractionation of common volatile petroleum hydrocarbons, including the C10-C14 n-alkanes, MTBE (tert-butyl methyl ether), and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene and o-xylene) during progressive vaporization under simulated experimental conditions. A decrease in ??D values for n-alkanes of up to 33.3??? and up to 44.5??? for BTEX compounds when 99{\%} of these substances had evaporated was observed. The results also show that H isotope fractionation increases with n-alkane chain length. Such fractionation patterns are interpreted in terms of competition between the decreased intermolecular binding energy in D-enriched species, and the isotope effect due to the mass difference. In contrast to hydrocarbons, methanol and ethanol show H isotopic enrichment during vaporization, indicating that H-bonding, when present in organic molecules, plays a controlling role on the vapor pressure of different isotope species. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Plants in constructed wetlands have several functions related to the treatment processes. It is generally agreed that nutrient uptake is a minor factor in constructed wetlands treating wastewater compared to the loadings applied. For low loaded systems plant uptake can contribute a significant amount to nutrient removal. The contribution of plant uptake is simulated for different qualities of water to be treated using the multi-component reactive transport module CW2D. CW2D is able to describe the biochemical elimination and transformation processes for organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The model for plant uptake implemented describes nutrient uptake coupled to water uptake. Literature values are used to calculate potential water and nutrient uptake rates. For a constructed wetland treating municipal wastewater a potential nutrient uptake of about 1.9{\%} of the influent nitrogen and phosphorus load can be expected. For lower loaded systems the potential uptake is significantly higher, e.g. 46{\%} of the nitrogen load for treatment of greywater. The potential uptake rates could only be simulated for high loaded systems i.e. constructed wetlands treating wastewater. For low loaded systems the nutrient concentrations in the liquid phase were too low to simulate the potential uptake rates using the implemented model for plant uptake.},

In addition, the effect of important constituents of natural water such as dissolved organic matter (DOM, isolated from Pamvotis Lake) and nitrate ions was also examined. It was found that photodegradation proceeds via a pseudo-first-order reaction in all cases. The presence of DOM inhibits the photolysis reaction with half-lives ranging from 87 to 693 h whereas the degradation rate was accelerated up to 11 times in the presence of NO(3)(-). In addition, the toxicity of the degradation products formed (generally through hydroxylation, dealkylation, and cyclization reactions) was also performed using the marine luminescent bacterium Vibrio fisheri. Our results indicated a toxicity increase of the irradiated solution showing that photoproducts of higher acute toxic effects were formed.},

abstract = {We have developed an alternative to the one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) attributed to Richards (1931) that describes unsaturated porous media flow in homogeneous soil layers. Our solution is a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived from unsaturated flux and mass conservation principles. We used a hodograph transformation, the Method of Lines, and a finite water-content discretization to produce ODEs that accurately simulate infiltration, falling slugs, and groundwater table dynamic effects on vadose zone fluxes. This formulation, which we refer to as “finite water-content”, simulates sharp fronts and is guaranteed to conserve mass using a finite-volume solution. Our ODE solution method is explicitly integrable, does not require iterations and therefore has no convergence limits and is computationally efficient. The method accepts boundary fluxes including arbitrary precipitation, bare soil evaporation, and evapotranspiration. The method can simulate heterogeneous soils using layers. Results are presented in terms of fluxes and water content profiles. Comparing our method against analytical solutions, laboratory data, and the Hydrus-1D solver, we find that predictive performance of our finite water-content ODE method is comparable to or in some cases exceeds that of the solution of Richards' equation, with or without a shallow water table. The presented ODE method is transformative in that it offers accuracy comparable to the Richards (1931) PDE numerical solution, without the numerical complexity, in a form that is robust, continuous, and suitable for use in large watershed and land-atmosphere simulation models, including regional-scale models of coupled climate and hydrology.},

abstract = {Pesticides applied on crops are leached with rainfall to groundwater and surface water. They threat the aquatic environment and may render water unfit for human consumption. Pesticide partitioning is one of the pesticide fate processes in the environment that should be properly formalised in pesticide fate models. Based on the analysis of 7 pesticide molecules (alachlor, atrazine, atrazine's transformation product deethylatrazine or DEA, isoproturon, tebuconazole and trifluralin) sampled from July 2009 to October 2010 at the outlet of the river Save (south-western France), the objectives of this study were (1) to check which of the environmental factors (discharge, pH, concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) could control the pesticide sorption dynamic, and (2) to establish a relationship between environmental factors, the partition coefficient Kd and the octanol/water distribution coefficient Kow. The comparison of physico-chemical parameters values during low flow and high flow shows that discharge, TSM and POC are the factors most likely controlling the pesticide sorption processes in the Save river network, especially for lower values of TSM (below 13mgL-1). We therefore express Kd depending on the widely literature-related variable Kow and on the commonly simulated variable TSM concentration. The equation can be implemented in any model describing the fluvial transport and fate of pesticides in both dissolved and sorbed phases, thus, Kd becomes a variable in time and space. The Kd calculation method can be applied to a wide range of catchments and organic contaminants. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary: CO2 fixation and uptake of sugars by Gallionella ferruginea were demonstrated by liquid scintillation and microautoradiographic techniques. The theoretical carbon content of a G. ferruginea cell in the exponential and stationary growth phases was calculated from size measurements of images of acridine-orange-stained cells. The carbon content of a cell in the exponential phase was 1middle dot25 x 10-14 mol and for a cell in the stationary phase it was 5 x 10-15 mol. G. ferruginea was shown to obtain all of its cell carbon from CO2 fixation when it was cultured under aerobic gradient conditions in a mineral salt solution with iron sulphide. Uptake experiments were performed with 1middle dot6 microM-14Cfrucose, 1middle dot6 microM-14Cfructose and 1middle dot3 microM-14Csucrose. There was significant uptake of all three sugars. Measurements of respired 14CO2 showed that 48{\%}, 25{\%} and 32{\%} of the total amount of incorporated sugar was respired for glucose, fructose and sucrose, respectively. The uptake of glucose increased when the glucose concentration in the growth medium was increased. At a glucose concentration of 10 microM or higher, the cell carbon was derived exclusively from glucose, within the errors of estimation. Mixotrophic growth with 20 microM-glucose decreased the CO2 fixation to 0middle dot4 x 10-14 mol carbon per cell, compared to autotrophically grown cells with 1middle dot0 x 10-14 mol carbon per cell. The addition of 20 microM-glucose gave an increase in cell number in the stationary phase from 1 x 106 to 5 x 106 cells ml-1.},

abstract = {Fe-oxide reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis, have been studied in a shallow aquifer with the main focus on sulfate reduction. Direct measurements of sulfate reduction rates have for the first time been applied in an aquifer system. Rates were much lower than reported in other anoxic environments - three orders of magnitude lower than in marine settings and one order of magnitude lower than in lacustrine environments, and varied substantially mainly due to differences in the reactivity of the organic matter. At the extremely low substrate levels in the aquifer, sulfate reduction rates are not primarily limited by low sulfate concentrations. The produced sulfide forms framboidal pyrite via a FeS precursor, with elemental sulfur as an intermediate. Fe-oxide reduction rates were comparable to sulfate reduction rates, but appeared to depend more on Fe-oxide reactivity than organic matter reactivity. Low sulfate concentrations, combined with low-reactivity Fe(III), in the aquifer sediment, has led to an increased appreciation of the existence of concomitant redox processes. This indicates that competitive exclusion is not always effective, and raises questions as to what H2 data reflect in such a system. Calculations of the in situ energy yield for Fe- and sulfate reduction via H2 oxidation are {\~{}}2.5 kcal/mol H2, indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium is approached. The calculated available energy yield for methanogenesis was very low indicating that CH4 production must occur in micro-environments where higher H2 concentrations prevail. The system may be described as being in a state of partial equilibrium, where the overall rate of organic matter oxidation is controlled by the rate of fermentation of the organic matter, and terminal electron acceptor processes occur at close to equilibrium conditions. This partial equilibrium depends on other processes in the system, in this case an increase in pH due to calcite dissolution appears to induce a shift from predominantly Fe-reducing to predominantly sulfate reducing conditions by changing the energy available to Fe-oxide reduction. Numerical modeling using the partial equilibrium approach was successful in modeling this complex of interacting processes.},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has increasingly been used as a  tool to assess intrinsic biodegradation at contaminated field sites. Typically, the Rayleigh equation is used to estimate the extent of biodegradation from measured isotope ratios of the contaminant. However, if the rate-limiting step in overall degradation is not the microbial reaction itself, the Rayleigh equation may no more be applicable. In this study we simulate biodegradation of continuously emitted petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater systems. These contaminants are effectively degraded at the plume fringe where transverse dispersion makes them mix with dissolved electron acceptors present in the ambient groundwater. We simulate reactive transport to study the coupled effects of transverse mixing and biodegradation on the spatial patterns of carbon isotope signatures and their interpretation based on depth-integrated sampling which represents the most common setup in the assessment of contaminated sites. We present scenarios mimicking a hydraulically uniform laboratory experiment and a field-scale application considering heterogeneous conductivity fields. We compare cases in which isotopologue-specific transverse dispersion is considered to those where this additional fractionation process is neglected. We show that these effects cause significant shifts in the isotopic signals and may lead to overestimation of biodegradation. Moreover, our results provide evidence that the rate-limiting effect of transverse mixing on the overall degradation spatially varies along the length of a steady-state contaminant plume. The control of biodegradation by transverse dispersion and the fractionating effect of dispersion modulate the fractionation caused by the microbial reaction alone. As a consequence, significantly nonlinear isotopic patterns are observed in a Rayleigh plot. Simulations in heterogeneous flow domains show that these effects persist at larger field scales and are sensitive to the degree of mixing enhancement, determined by the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity fields, and to the groundwater flow velocity.},

abstract = {Microbial ecologists and environmental engineers share the interest in identifying the key microorganisms responsible for compound turnover in the environment and in estimating the respective transformation rates. For the successful application of Natural Attenuation processes, a reliable assessment of the in situ turnover of a contaminant in an aquifer is essential. Here, we review and present new details of two recently developed approaches concerning the assessment of in situ biodegradation: (i) determination of biodegradation caused by microbial metabolism in a contamination plume by stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) and (ii) determination of the actual degradation under the respective environmental conditions in the aquifer by using in situ microcosms (BACTRAPS{\textregistered}) amended with 13C-labeled substrates as tracer compounds. Based on stable isotope fractionation analysis, the degradation occurring under anoxic biogeochemical conditions at a respective site can be calculated for the entire plume. This has been shown for benzene and toluene at the Zeitz site and partly for chlorobenzene at the Bitterfeld site. By use of the in situ microcosm approach with 13C-labeled compounds, the microbial in situ degradation under strictly anaerobic conditions could be proven for benzene and toluene in Zeitz and for chlorobenzene in Bitterfeld. The transformation of 13C-carbon of the labeled substrate into microbial fatty acids confirmed the assimilation of the pollutant resulting in the formation of biomass. In addition, metabolites such as benzylsuccinic acid were found in the toluene-amended microcosms indicating anaerobic degradation of toluene. This result corresponds to the geochemical conditions found at the field site and therefore, the microcosm approach with 13C-labeled compounds can be used to assign the predominant in situ degradation pathways in a contaminated aquifer. Since fatty acids profiles alone are often too unspecific for a community analysis at species level, the composition of the microbial communities was analyzed by genetic profiling and sequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes PCR-amplified from total DNA extracted directly from the microcosms. Sequences retrieved from the microcosms indicated a dominance of not yet cultivated bacteria. Several sequences were phylogenetically closely related to sequences of bacteria known to be iron and sulfate reducers, typically found at sites polluted with BTEX and/or mineral oil. The results show that the current methods for monitoring microbial in situ activity at present stage are valuable tools for improving environmental control of compound turnover and will speed up engineering approaches.},

abstract = {Remediation of aquifers containing trichloroethylene (TCE) relies primarily on physical extraction of contaminated groundwater and soil. Unfortunately, this is typically expensive and does not always attain the desired treatment goals. In situ bioremediation via natural attenuation is an alternative treatment process in which TCE is transformed by indigenous microorganisms and plants. In this study, TCE was observed in a surficial aquifer that discharges into a wetland. Experiments were undertaken to determine whether natural attenuation of TCE in the wetland was possible. Microcosms were constructed using sandy soil??eastern cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) from the wetland's edge and organic soil??broad-leaved cattails (Typha latifolia) from the wetland's interior. [14C] TCE was added to each microcosm (1.27??Ci). Overtime, 14C was recovered from four microcosm compartments: (1) as 14C bound to soil and water, (2) as volatilized [14C] TCE, (3) as [14C] CO2 produced by mineralization of [14C] TCE, and (4) as 14C incorporated into the plants. Total recoveries of the 14C-label ranged from 73.6{\%} to 95.8{\%}. Volatilized [14C] TCE accounted for the majority ({\textgreater}50{\%}) of the recovered label. In microcosms without plants, [14C] CO2 represented 3.2{\%} (organic soil) to 15.6{\%} (sandy soil) of the recovered 14C, indicating that TCE was mineralized by indigenous microorganisms. The presence of the broad-leaved cattail resulted in increased production of [14C] CO2 to 5.3{\%} in the organic soil. The data thus suggest that natural attenuation is a potential bioremediative strategy for TCE-contaminated wetlands. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {To accurately interpret isotopic data obtained for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dissolved in groundwater systems, the isotopic effects of subsurface processes must be understood. Previous work has demonstrated that volatilization and dissolution of BTEX and chlorinated ethene compounds are not significantly isotopically fractionating. This study characterized the carbon isotopic effects of equilibrium sorption of perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, benzene, and toluene to both graphite and activated carbon directly in batch experiments over a range of 10-90{\%} sorption. Results demonstrate that, over this range, equilibrium sorption of these VOCs to graphite and activated carbon does not result in significant carbon isotopic fractionation within the +/-0.5{\%} accuracy and reproducibility associated with compound-specific isotope analysis. This implies that the isotopic values of dissolved VOCs will not be significantly affected by equilibrium sorption in the subsurface. Therefore, isotopic analysis has potential to be used in the field to differentiate between mass losses due to isotopically fractionating processes such as biodegradation versus mass loss due to nondegradative processes.},

abstract = {Life and element cycling on Earth is directly related to electron transfer (or redox) reactions. An understanding of biogeochemical redox processes is crucial for predicting and protecting environmental health and can provide new opportunities for engineered remediation strategies. Energy can be released and stored by means of redox reactions via the oxidation of labile organic carbon or inorganic compounds (electron donors) by microorganisms coupled to the reduction of electron acceptors including humic substances, iron-bearing minerals, transition metals, metalloids, and actinides. Environmental redox processes play key roles in the formation and dissolution of mineral phases. Redox cycling of naturally occurring trace elements and their host minerals often controls the release or sequestration of inorganic contaminants. Redox processes control the chemical speciation, bioavailability, toxicity, and mobility of many major and trace elements including Fe, Mn, C, P, N, S, Cr, Cu, Co, As, Sb, Se, Hg, Tc, and U. Redox-active humic substances and mineral surfaces can catalyze the redox transformation and degradation of organic contaminants. In this review article, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of biogeochemical redox processes and their impact on contaminant fate and transport, including future research needs.},

abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A computational method is derived for the determination of the residual water content and for the extrapolation of the water content-capillary head curve as measured in a limited range. The proposed model is compared with the existing practical models of Averjanov (1950), Wyllie and Gardner (1958), and Millington and Quirk (1961) on the basis of the measured data of 45 soils.

Microorganisms indigenous to creek bed sediments, where groundwater contaminated with chlorinated ethenes continuously discharges, demonstrated significant mineralization of DCE and VC under methanogenic and Fe(III)-reducing conditions. Over 37 days,the recovery of 1,2-C-14VC radioactivity as (CO2)-C-14 ranged from 5{\%} to 44{\%} and from 8{\%} to 100{\%} under methanogenic and Fe(III)-reducing conditions, respectively. The recovery of 1,2-C-14DCE radioactivity as (CO2)-C-14 ranged from 4{\%} to 14{\%} and did not vary significantly between methanogenic and Fe(III)-reducing conditions. VC mineralization was described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Under methanogenic conditions, V-max was 0.19 0.01 mu mol L-1 d(-1) and the half-saturation constant, k(m), was 7.6 1.7 mu M. Under Fe(III)-reducing conditions, V-max was 0.76 0.07 mu mol L-1 d(-1) and k(m) was 1.3 0.5 mu M. In contrast, DCE mineralization could be described by first-order kinetics. The first-order degradation rate constant for DCE mineralization was 0.6 0.2{\%} d(-1) under methanogenic and Fe(III)-reducing conditions. The results indicate that the kinetics of chlorinated ethene mineralization can vary significantly with the specific contaminant and the predominant redox conditions under which mineralization occurs.},

abstract = {Agricultural pesticide use has increased worldwide during the last several decades, but the long-term fate, storage, and transfer dynamics of pesticides in a changing environment are poorly understood. Many pesticides have been progressively banned, but in numerous cases, these molecules are stable and may persist in soils, sediments, and ice. Many studies have addressed the question of their possible remobilization as a result of global change. In this article, we present a retro-observation approach based on lake sediment records to monitor micropollutants and to evaluate the long-term succession and diffuse transfer of herbicides, fungicides, and insecticide treatments in a vineyard catchment in France. The sediment allows for a reliable reconstruction of past pesticide use through time, validated by the historical introduction, use, and banning of these organic and inorganic pesticides in local vineyards. Our results also revealed how changes in these practices affect storage conditions and, consequently, the pesticides' transfer dynamics. For example, the use of postemergence herbicides (glyphosate), which induce an increase in soil erosion, led to a release of a banned remnant pesticide (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, DDT), which had been previously stored in vineyard soil, back into the environment. Management strategies of ecotoxicological risk would be well served by recognition of the diversity of compounds stored in various environmental sinks, such as agriculture soil, and their capability to become sources when environmental conditions change.},

Understanding the pesticide transport and the tradeoffs associated with the various management practices is greatly facilitated by the use of physically-based contaminant transport models. In this study, performance of Joyce's et al. (2008) pesticide transport model was evaluated using experimental data collected from two ground treatments such as resident vegetation and bare soil. The model simulation results obtained in calibration and validation process were analyzed for pesticide concentration and total load. The pesticide transport model accurately predicted the pesticide concentrations and total load in the runoff from bare field and was capable of simulating chemical responses to rainfall-runoff events. In case of resident vegetation, the model results exhibited a larger range of variation than was observed in the bare soil simulations due to increased model parameterization with the addition of foliage and thatch compartments. Furthermore, the model was applied to study the effect of runoff lag time, extent of crop cover, organic content of soil and post-application irrigation on the pesticide peak concentration and total load. Based on the model results, recommendations were suggested to growers prior to implementing certain management decisions to mitigate diazinon transport in the orchard's spray runoff. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Volatilization of toxic organic contaminants from groundwater to the soil surface is often considered an important pathway in risk analysis. Most of the risk models use simplified linear solutions that may overpredict the volatile flux. Although complex numerical models have been developed, their use is restricted to experienced users and for sites where field data are known in great detail. We present here a novel semianalytical model running on a spreadsheet that simulates the volatilization flux and vertical concentration profile in a soil based on the Van Genuchten functions. These widely used functions describe precisely the gas and water saturations and movement in the capillary fringe. The analytical model shows a good accuracy over several orders of magnitude when compared to a numerical model and laboratory data. The effect of barometric pumping is also included in the semianalytical formulation, although the model predicts that barometric pumping is often negligible. A sensitivity study predicts significant fluxes in sandy vadose zones and much smaller fluxes in other soils. Fluxes are linked to the dimensionless Henry's law constant H for H {\textless} 0.2 and increase by approximately 20{\%} when temperature increases from 5 to 25 degrees C.},

abstract = {The Rayleigh equation is commonly applied to evaluate the extent of degradation at contaminated sites for which compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) data are available. However, it was shown recently that (i) the Rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of biodegradation in physically heterogeneous systems, while (ii) it overestimates biodegradation if sorption-based carbon isotope fractionation is relevant. This paper further explores these two isotope effects not captured by the Rayleigh equation by means of a numerical modeling approach. The reactive multicomponent transport simulations show that the systematic underestimation is considerably larger for fringe-controlled and Monod-type degradation reactions than for previously assumed redox-insensitive first-order degradation kinetics, while forthe nonsteady state front portion of plumes, the Rayleigh equation may falsely indicate the occurrence of and/or overestimate biodegradation. The latter anomaly results from carbon isotope fractionation during sorption. It occurs for both supply-controlled degradation at the plume fringe and slow, reaction-controlled degradation inside the plume core. The numerical model approach enables a more accurate interpretation of CSIA data and thereby improves the quantification of biodegradation processes.},

abstract = {Stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) of contaminants is an emerging technique to characterize in situ microbial activity. The kinetic isotope effect in microbial degradation reactions, or enzyme catalysis, is caused by the preferential cleavage of bonds containing light rather than heavy isotopes. This leads to a relative enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the residual substrate pool. However, a number of nonisotopically sensitive steps preceding the isotopically sensitive bond cleavage may affect the reaction kinetics of a degradation process, thus reducing the observed (i.e., the macroscopically detectable) isotope fractionation. Low bioavailability of contaminants poses kinetic limitations on the biodegradation process and can significantly reduce the observed kinetic isotope fractionation. Here we present experimental evidence for the influence of bioavailability-limited pollutant biodegradation on observed stable isotope fractionation. Batch laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the toluene hydrogen isotope fractionation of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 (pWWO) subjected to different small concentrations of toluene with and without deuterium label, which corresponded to realistic environmental mass transfer scenarios. Detected isotope fractionations depended significantly on the toluene concentration, hence confirming the influence of substrate mass transfer limitation on observed isotope fractionation, hypothesized by Thullner et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42,6544-6551). Our results indicate that the bioavailability of a substrate should be considered during quantitative analysis of microbial degradation based on SIFA.},

Groundwater interacts with surface water in nearly all landscapes, ranging from small streams, lakes, and wetlands in headwater areas to major river valleys and seacoasts. Although it gener- ally is assumed that topographically high areas are groundwater recharge areas and topographically low areas are groundwater discharge areas, this is true primarily for regional flow systems. The superposition of local flow systems associated with surface-water bodies on this regional framework results in complex interactions between groundwater and surface water in all landscapes, regardless of regional topographic posi- tion. Hydrologic processes associated with the surface- water bodies themselves, such as seasonally high surface-water levels and evaporation and transpiration of groundwater from around the perimeter of surface- water bodies, are a major cause of the complex and seasonally dynamic groundwater flow fields associated with surface water.

abstract = {Sorption, biodegradation and hydraulic parameters were determined in the laboratory for two candidate soil substrate mixtures for construction of an upflow treatment wetland for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at a Superfund site. The major parent contaminants in the groundwater at the Superfund site were cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA). The two mixtures - one a mixture of sand and peat, the other a mixture of sand, peat and Bion Soil, a product derived from agricultural wastes - were selected from ten possible mixtures based on the results of hydraulic and geotechnical testing. The sand and peat mixture had an average hydraulic conductivity of 4.95 x l0-4 cm/s with a critical flow of 39.5 gpm/acre (368 l/min/ha) without fluidization of the bed. The sand, peat and Bion Soil mixture had an average hydraulic conductivity of 3.02 x 10-4 cm/s with a critical flow of 36.8 gpm/acre (344 l/min/ha) without fluidization of the bed. Retardation coefficients ranged from 1 to 7.3 for target VOCs with higher coefficients observed in the mixture containing the Bion Soil. Consistently higher spatial and temporal first-order removal rate constants were observed in the sand, peat and Bion Soil mixture (cis-1,2-DCE, 0.84??0.36/day; 1,1,1-TCA, 6.52??3.12/day) than in the sand and peat mixture (cis-1,2-DCE, 0.37??0.13/day; 1,1,1-TCA, 1.48??0.42/day). Results from anaerobic microcosm studies confirmed that biodegradation was occurring in the columns and that the sand, peat and Bion Soil mixture had higher degradation rate than the sand and peat mixture. Vinyl chloride (VC) was identified as a 'design' contaminant since it is a proven carcinogen and had the lowest removal rate constant for both substrate mixtures. Effective wetland bed depths for VC removal of 900 and 210 cm will be required for peat and sand alone and sand, peat and Bion Soil mixtures, respectively. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The abiotic rate of reductive dissolution thus correlates with the solubility of the iron oxyhydroxides. We investigated whether this also holds for the microbial reduction kinetics of Fe(III) iron oxyhydroxides. The solubilities of nanoparticulate hematite, lepidocrocite, ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxide were obtained from pe-pH titrations of oxyhydroxide/Fe2+(aq) suspensions, in pH range 4 to 7. The solubility of low surface area (LSA) hematite was estimated from redox potential measurements at pH 2. The same solid phases and soluble Fe(III)-citrate were then reduced by the iron reducing bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens using lactate as the electron donor. In all cases, the microbial Fe(III) reduction rates exhibited saturation behavior with respect to the initial Fe(III) concentration. The maximum specific rate of reduction (vmax, in ??mol cell-1 h-1) correlated positively with the solubility of the Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, with the highest values of vmax for ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe(III) oxide, the lowest for LSA hematite. Hence, the solubility appears to be a rate-controlling parameter in both the abiotic and enzymatic reduction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, our understanding of the complex processes caused by the plants, microorganisms, soil matrix and substances in the wastewater, and how they all interact with each other, is still rather incomplete. In this article, a closer look will be taken at the mechanisms of both plants in constructed wetlands and the microorganisms in the root zone which come into play when they remove contaminants from wastewater. The supply of oxygen plays a crucial role in the activity and type of metabolism performed by microorganisms in the root zone. Plants' involvement in the input of oxygen into the root zone, in the uptake of nutrients and in the direct degradation of pollutants as well as the role of microorganisms are all examined in more detail. The ways in which these processes act to treat wastewater are dealt with in the following order: • Technological aspects; • The effect of root growth on the soil matrix; • Gas transport in helophytes and the release of oxygen into the rhizosphere; The uptake of inorganic compounds by plants; The uptake of organic pollutants by plants and their metabolism; The release of carbon compounds by plants; Factors affecting the elimination of pathogenic germs. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Sterilized soil is often used, for example in degradation studies, sorption experiments, microbiological tests and plant test systems, to distinguish between microbial processes and abiotic reactions. The most commonly used technique for sterilization is autoclaving of the soil. Another technique is irradiation with high-level gamma radiation (gamma-radiation). One major drawback of sterilization procedures is the possible alteration of the structure of soil components, for example the organic matter. A change in the chemical structure of the soil organic matter can cause different reactions in the above-mentioned experiments and hence interfere with the aim of clearly distinguishing between biotic and abiotic processes. Two soils (Gleyic Cambisol and Orthic Luvisol) were sterilized by two gamma-irradiation procedures (4 kGy hour(-1) for 9 hours and 1.3 kGy hour(-1) for 27 hours) and repeated autoclaving at 121 degrees C. Gentle physical aggregate fractionation of the sterilized soils revealed a decrease in the aggregation of the soil, which was reflected in an increase of the clay fraction. Subsequent analysis of the aqueous phase revealed much more dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the gamma-sterilized and autoclaved soils than in the untreated soils. Ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence spectra of the DOM showed a decrease in the aromaticity and polycondensation of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). (13)C cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C-CP/MAS NMR) spectra of the unfractionated soils and their respective soil fractions before and after sterilization showed that the most important change occurred in the carbohydrate and N-alkyl region, the main components of microorganisms. In general, the impact of the sterilization method was stronger for autoclaving. The gamma-sterilized soils and fractions displayed both fewer and smaller changes in the soil organic matter.},

abstract = {This work presents analytical models which are able to predict contours of concentrations and isotope ratios of organic pollutants in homogeneous aquifers. Four analytical solutions of the advective-dispersive transport equation for reactive transport from the literature differing in assumptions regarding biodegradation kinetics were used. Stable isotope ratios are computed after modelling the individual reactive transport of isotopic species in the aquifer, which respond differently to fractionation by biodegradation or sorption. The main finding of this study is that the isotope ratios in the plumes are very sensitive to the assumptions underlying the biodegradation kinetics in the models. When biodegradation occurs throughout the core of the plume as first-order reaction, the transversal gradients in isotope ratios are smooth. When biodegradation occurs in a bi-molecular reaction with an electron acceptor (modelled by double-Monod kinetics), steep transversal isotope gradients are predicted. When the reaction rates approach instantaneous reaction along the plume fringes, isotope shifts in the core of the plume disappear. A model incorporating plume and fringe degradation produces the most plausible predictions of isotope ratios in this study. It is shown furthermore that isotope fractionation by sorption causes an even different pattern of isotope ratios, with positive shifts restricted to near the forerunning front of an expanding plume. The models developed in this work can serve for the validation of numerical models and may be incorporated in natural attenuation support systems such as e.g. BIOSCREEN. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Methane is a chemically and radiatively important atmospheric trace gas. Emission from wetlands is a significant component of the atmospheric CH4 budget, releasing 145 Tg CH4 annually to the atmosphere, or about 25{\%} of total emissions from all anthropogenic and natural sources. Wetlands are characterized by a subsurface, anaerobic zone of CH4 production by methanogenic bacteria and an surficial, aerobic zone of CH4 oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. Wetlands transfer CH4 to the atmosphere by diffusion, ebullition, and by transport through arenchymous vascular plants. However, about 20 to 40{\%} of the CH4 produced in anaerobic wetland soils is oxidized in the rhizosphere and in surficial oxic layers during diffusive transport to the soil surface. Rates of CH4 emission in wetlands are commonly 100 mg m-2 day-1, and represent the net effect of production and consumption. Water table position, temperature, and plant community composition are important ecosystemlevel controls on wetland CH4 emission.},

abstract = {Large errors in peak discharge estimates at catchment scales can be ascribed to errors in the estimation of catchment response time. The time parameters most frequently used to express catchment response time are the time of concentration (T C), lag time (T L) and time to peak (T P). This paper presents a review of the time parameter estimation methods used internationally, with selected comparisons in medium and large catchments in the C5 secondary drainage region in South Africa. The comparison of different time parameter estimation methods with recommended methods used in South Africa confirmed that the application of empirical methods, with no local correction factors, beyond their original developmental regions, must be avoided. The T C is recognized as the most frequently used time parameter, followed by T L . In acknowledging this, as well as the basic assumptions of the approximations T L = 0.6T C and T C ≈ T P , along with the similarity between the definitions of the T P and the conceptual T C , it was evident that the latter two time parameters should be further investigated to develop an alternative approach to estimate representative response times that result in improved estimates of peak discharge at these catchment scales.

abstract = {There are currently no industry-wide standards for the calibration and specification of water-level monitoring pressure transducers. Consequently, specifications from different manufacturers are currently not directly comparable, and different branded sensors may not perform similarly under the same environmental conditions. This has been highlighted by the varied performance of 14 leading brands of pressure transducers under test conditions. In laboratory tests, transducers generally met product accuracy specifications, although temperature compensation was substandard in five absolute sensors. In a 99-day field test, accuracy was typically within around ±10 mm for lower range pressure sensors, which exceeded some product specifications. Furthermore, there was evidence for linear and curved forms of instrument drift. As a result of the diverse performance of the transducers, it is recommended that an industry-wide standard for calibration and specification is introduced. This would eliminate any uncertainty surrounding the current procedures and lead to more informed procurement by the user who would have a greater understanding of comparative instrument performance. Any new standard should also address sensor drift which is currently rarely cited in product specifications.},

abstract = {Managing the risk associated with hazardous organic compounds in ground water at hazardous waste sites often requires detailed knowledge of the extent of degradation of the organic contaminants at the site. An evaluation of the contribution of natural biodegradation or abiotic transformation processes in ground water is usually crucial to the selection of Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) as a remedy for a site. Documentation that the organic contaminant is actually being degraded is important for performance monitoring of MNA, performance monitoring of active in situ bioremediation, and performance monitoring of many other active remedial technologies.$\backslash$nThe traditional approach of monitoring a reduction in the concentrations of contaminants at sites often does not offer compelling documentation that the contaminants are actually being degraded. When data on concentrations are the only data available, it is difficult or impossible to exclude the possibility that the reduction in contaminant concentrations are caused by some other process such as dilution or dispersion, or that the monitoring wells failed to adequately sample the plume of contaminated ground water. Stable isotope analyses can provide unequivocal documentation that biodegradation or abiotic transformation processes actually destroyed the contaminant.$\backslash$nWhen organic contaminants are degraded in the environment, the ratio of stable isotopes will often change, and the extent of degradation can be recognized and predicted from the change in the ratio of stable isotopes. Recent advances in analytical chemistry make it possible to perform Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) on dissolved organic contaminants such as chlorinated solvents, aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons, and fuel oxygenates, at concentrations in water that are near their regulatory standards.$\backslash$nAt many hazardous waste sites, progress toward cleanup of contamination in ground water depends on successful identification of the true sour},

abstract = {Aerobic bacteria that grow on vinyl chloride (VC) have been isolated previously, but their diversity and distribution are largely unknown. It is also unclear whether such bacteria contribute to the natural attenuation of VC at chlorinated-ethene-contaminated sites. We detected aerobic VC biodegradation in 23 of 37 microcosms and enrichments inoculated with samples from various sites. Twelve different bacteria (11 Mycobacterium strains and 1 Nocardioides strain) capable of growth on VC as the sole carbon source were isolated, and 5 representative strains were examined further. All the isolates grew on ethene in addition to VC and contained VC-inducible ethene monooxygenase activity. The Mycobacterium strains (JS60, JS61, JS616, and JS617) all had similar growth yields (5.4 to 6.6 g of protein/mol), maximum specific growth rates (0.17 to 0.23 day(-1)), and maximum specific substrate utilization rates (9 to 16 nmol/min/mg of protein) with VC. The Nocardioides strain (JS614) had a higher growth yield (10.3 g of protein/mol), growth rate (0.71 day(-1)), and substrate utilization rate (43 nmol/min/mg of protein) with VC but was much more sensitive to VC starvation. Half-velocity constant (K(s)) values for VC were between 0.5 and 3.2 micro M, while K(s) values for oxygen ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 mg/liter. Our results indicate that aerobic VC-degrading microorganisms (predominantly Mycobacterium strains) are widely distributed at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents and are likely to be responsible for the natural attenuation of VC.},

abstract = {Linear free energy relationships (LFERs) were established which relate equilibrium vapor-liquid isotope effects to stable carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment factors for equilibrium sorption to geosorbents. The LFERs were established for normal, cyclic or branched alkanes, monoaromatic hydrocarbons, and chloroethenes. These LFERs predict that isotopic light compounds sorb more strongly than their heavy counterparts. Defining fractionation as in classical literature by "heavy divided by light", carbon enrichment factors for equilibrium sorption were derived which ranged from - 0.13 ?? 0.04??? (benzene) to - 0.52 ?? 0.19??? (trichloroethene at 5-15 ??C). Hydrogen enrichment factors for sorption of 14 different compounds were between - 2.4 and - 9.2???. For perdeuterated hydrocarbons the predicted enrichment factors ranged from - 19 ?? 5.4??? (benzene) to - 64 ?? 30??? (cyclohexane). Equilibrium sorption experiments with a soil and activated carbon as sorbents were performed in the laboratory for perdeuterocyclohexane and perdeuterotoluene. The measured D/H enrichments agreed with the LFER prediction for both compounds and both sorbents within the uncertainty estimate of the prediction. The results of this work suggest that equilibrium sorption does create only very small isotope shifts for 13C in groundwater pollutants in aquifers. It is also suggested that deuterium shifts are expected to be higher, especially for strongly sorbing pollutants. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Discharge of DCE and VC to an aerobic surface water system simultaneously represents a significant environmental concern and, potentially, a non-engineered opportunity for efficient contaminant bioremediation. The potential for bioremediation, however, depends on the ability of the stream-bed microbial community to efficiently and completely degrade DCE and VC over a range of contaminant concentrations. The purposes of the studies reported here were to assess the potential for aerobic DCE and VC mineralization by stream-bed microorganisms and to evaluate the effects of DCE and VC concentrations on the apparent rates of aerobic mineralization. Bed-sediment microorganisms indigenous to a creek, where DCE-contaminated groundwater continuously discharges, demonstrated rapid mineralization of DCE and VC under aerobic conditions. Over 8 days, the recovery of [1,2-14C]DCE radioactivity as 14CO2 ranged from 17{\%} to 100{\%}, and the recovery of [1,2-14C]VC radioactivity as 14CO2 ranged from 45{\%} to 100{\%}. Rates of DCE and VC mineralization increased significantly with increasing contaminant concentration, and the response of apparent mineralization rates to changes in DCE and VC concentrations was adequately described by Michaelis?Menten kinetics.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study was to determine the sorption and biodegradation parameters of trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) as input data required for their fate and transport modelling in a Quaternary sandy aquifer. Sorption was determined based on batch and column experiments, while biodegradation was investigated using the compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA). The aquifer materials medium (soil 1) to fine (soil 2) sands and groundwater samples came from the representative profile of the contaminated site (south-east Poland). The sorption isotherms were approximately linear (TCE, soil 1, K d = 0.0016; PCE, soil 1, K d = 0.0051; PCE, soil 2, K d = 0.0069) except for one case in which the best fitting was for the Langmuir isotherm (TCE, soil 2, K f = 0.6493 and S max = 0.0145). The results indicate low retardation coefficients (R) of TCE and PCE; however, somewhat lower values were obtained in batch compared to column experiments. In the column experiments with the presence of both contaminants, TCE influenced sorption of PCE, so that the R values for both compounds were almost two times higher. Non-significant differences in isotope compositions of TCE and PCE measured in the observation points ($\delta$(13)C values within the range of -23.6 ÷ -24.3 ‰ and -26.3 ÷-27.7 ‰, respectively) indicate that biodegradation apparently is not an important process contributing to the natural attenuation of these contaminants in the studied sandy aquifer.},

abstract = {Zero-valent iron (ZVI) permeable-reactive barriers have become an increasingly used remediation option for the in situ removal of various organic and inorganic chemicals from contaminated groundwater. In the present study a process-based numerical model for the transport and reactions of chlorinated hydrocarbon in the presence of ZVI has been developed and applied to analyse a comprehensive data set from laboratory-scale flow-through experiments. The model formulation includes a reaction network for the individual sequential and/or parallel transformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons by ZVI, for the resulting geochemical changes such as mineral precipitation, and for the carbon isotope fractionation that occurs during each of the transformation reactions of the organic compounds. The isotopic fractionation was modelled by formulating separate reaction networks for lighter (12C) and heavier (13C) isotopes. The simulation of a column experiment involving the parallel degradation of TCE by hydrogenolysis and $\beta$-elimination can conclusively reproduce the observed concentration profiles of all collected organic and inorganic data as well as the observed carbon isotope ratios of TCE and its daughter products. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Metolachlor is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world for controlling weeds. It has been detected in both ground and surface waters in the United States, and there are rising concerns in regard to its health risks and in developing effective treatment processes for its removal from water. Degradation of metolachlor via ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and an UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process (AOP) was studied. The quantum yield of metolachlor at 254 nm was found to be 0.302 +/- 0.001 mol E-1 through direct UV photolysis in the range of pH 6-8. The second-order rate constant of the reaction between metolachlor and hydroxyl radical was determined to be 9.07 (+/-0.21) x 10(9) M-1 s-1 by using a competition kinetics model that utilized nitrobenzene as a reference compound. In addition, these parameters were successfully applied in modeling the kinetics of elimination of metolachlor using an UV/H2O2 process in both laboratory and natural waters. The formation of several photolysis byproducts was identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and a scheme for the metolachlor photodegradation pathway is proposed.},

abstract = {A simple, fast, and inexpensive method for the de- termination of pesticide residues in fruits and veg- etables is introduced. The procedure involves ini- tial single-phase extraction of 10 g sample with 10 mL acetonitrile, followed by liquid–liquid parti- tioning formed by addition of 4 g anhydrous MgSO4 plus 1 g NaCl. Removal of residual water and cleanup are performed simultaneously by us- ing a rapid procedure called dispersive solid-phase extraction (dispersive-SPE), in which 150 mg anhy- drous MgSO4 and 25 mg primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbent are simply mixed with 1mL acetonitrile extract. The dispersive-SPE with PSA effectively removes many polar matrix compo- nents, such as organic acids, certain polar pig- ments, and sugars, to some extent from the food extracts. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is then used for quantitative and confir- matory analysis of GC-amenable pesticides. Re- coveries between 85 and 101{\%}(mostly {\textgreater}95{\%}) and repeatabilities typically {\textless}5{\%}have been achieved for a wide range of fortified pesticides, including very polar and basic compounds such as methamidophos, acephate, omethoate, imazalil, and thiabendazole.

abstract = {Spills of chloroethenes (CEs) at industrial and urban sites can create groundwater plumes in which tetrachloro- and trichloroethene sequentially degrade to dichloroethenes, vinyl chloride (VC) and ethene, or ethane under reducing conditions. For detoxification, degradation must go beyond VC. Assessments based on ethene and ethane, however, are difficult because these products are volatile, may stem from alternative sources, can be further transformed and are not always monitored. To alternatively quantify degradation beyond VC, stable carbon isotope mass balances have been proposed where concentration-weighted CE isotope ratios are summed up and compared to the original source isotope ratio. Reported assessments, however, have provided not satisfactorily quantified results entailing greatly differing upper and lower estimates. This work proposes an integrative approach to better constrain the extent of total chloroethene degradation in groundwater samples. It is based on fitting of measured concentration and compound-specific stable carbon isotope data to an analytical reactive transport equation simulating steady-state plumes in two dimensions using an EXCEL spreadsheet. The fitting also yields estimates of degradation rates, of source width and of dispersivities. The approach is validated using two synthetic benchmark cases where the true extent of degradation is well known, and using data from two real field cases from literature.},

abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used to define the flow direction in distributed hydrological models for simulation of streamflow. In recent decades, numerous methods for flow direction determination have been applied successfully to mountainous regions. Nevertheless, some problems still exist when those methods are used for flat or gently sloped areas. The present study reviews the conventional methods of determining flow direction for such landscapes and analyzes the problems of these methods. Two different methods of determining flow direction are discussed and were applied to the Xitiaoxi Catchment, located in the Taihu Basin in southern China, which has both mountainous and flat terrain. Both the agree method and the shortest path method use drainage networks derived from a remote sensing image to determine the correct location of the stream. The results indicate that the agree method provides a better fit with the DEM for the hilly region than the shortest path method. For the flat region where the flow has been diverted and rerouted by land managers, both methods require observation of the drainage network to determine the flow direction. In order to clarify the applicability of the two methods, both are employed in catchment hydrological models conceptually based on the Xinanjiang model and implemented with PCRaster. The simulation results show that both methods can be successfully applied in hydrological modeling. There are no evident differences in the modeled discharge when using the two methods at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Since 2011, the enantiospecific stable carbon isotope analysis (ESIA) has emerged as an innovative technique to assess the environmental fate of chiral emerging compounds by combining in one experimental technique both compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and enantioselective analysis. To date, the ESIA was applied for four classes of compounds: $\alpha$-hexachlorocyclohexane ($\alpha$-HCH), polar herbicides (phenoxy acids), synthetic polycyclic musk galaxolide (HHCB), and phenoxyalkanoic methyl herbicides. From an analytical point of view there are factors that are hindering the application of ESIA methods for the field samples: (i.e. amounts of target analyte, matrix effects, GC resolution) and overcoming these factors is challenging. While ESIA was shown as a mature technique for the first three abovementioned class of compounds, no isotope analysis of individual enantiomers could be performed for phenoxyalkanoic methyl herbicides. With respect to field studies, one study showed that ESIA might be a promising tool to distinguish between biotic and abiotic transformation pathways of chiral organic contaminants and even to differentiate between their aerobic and anaerobic biotransformation pathways. The development of ESIA methods for new chiral emerging contaminants in combination with development of multi-element isotope analysis will contribute to a better characterization of transformation pathways of chiral organic contaminants.},

abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is a promising tool to study the environmental fate of a wide range of contaminants including pesticides. In this study, a novel CSIA method was developed to analyse the stable carbon isotope signatures of widely used chloroacetanilide herbicides. The developed method was applied in combination with herbicide concentration and hydrochemical analyses to investigate in situ biodegradation of metolachlor, acetochlor and alachlor during their transport in lab-scale wetlands. Two distinct redox zones were identified in the wetlands. Oxic conditions prevailed close to the inlet of the four wetlands (oxygen concentration of 212??24??M), and anoxic conditions (oxygen concentrations of 28??41??M) prevailed towards the outlet, where dissipation of herbicides mainly occurred. Removal of acetochlor and alachlor from inlet to outlet of wetlands was 56{\%} and 51{\%}, whereas metolachlor was more persistent (23{\%} of load dissipation). CSIA of chloroacetanilides at the inlet and outlet of the wetlands revealed carbon isotope fractionation of alachlor (??bulk=-2.0??0.3???) and acetochlor (??bulk=-3.4??0.5???), indicating that biodegradation contributes to the dissipation of both herbicides. This study is a first step towards the application of CSIA to evaluate the transport and degradation of chloroacetanilide herbicides in the environment. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Adsorption-desorption of ESA and OA in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are required to assess the mobility of these compounds in VFSS. The objective of this experiment was to compare metolachlor, ESA, and OA adsorption and desorption parameters between VFSS and cultivated soil (CS). Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined using the batch equilibrium procedure. With the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in organic carbon content in the VFSS, the evaluated chemical and physical properties of the soils were similar. Sorption coefficients for metolachlor were 88{\%} higher in VFSS than in CS. In contrast, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 79{\%} lower in both soils. Metolachlor desorption coefficients were 59{\%} higher in the VFSS than in the CS. Desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 66{\%} lower in both soils. These data indicate that the mobility of ESA and OA will be greater than metolachlor in both soils. However, higher organic carbon content in VFSS relative to CS may limit the subsequent transport of metolachlor from the vegetated filter strip.},

Additionally, in situ microcosm systems loaded with 13C-labelled MCB were deployed for the first time in sediments to investigate the biotransformation of MCB. Incorporation of 13C-labelled carbon derived from the MCB into bacterial fatty acids substantiated in situ degradation of MCB. The detection of 13C-labelled benzene indicated reductive dehalogenation of MCB. This integrated approach indicated the natural attenuation of the MCB in a wetland system.

abstract = {This study quantifies and models the influence of the type and the degree of decomposition of cover crops (CC) on three pesticides sorption: epoxiconazole (EPX), S-metolachlor (SMOC) and glyphosate (GLY). Residues of four cover crop species were incubated for 0, 6, 28 or 56d in controlled conditions. For each incubation time, adsorption of pesticides on CC residues was measured in batch experiments. Additionally, the biochemical and elemental composition (Van Soest fractionation, C:N, 13C NMR spectroscopy) of CC was characterized. Mineralization of CC residues was monitored at all incubation times using CO2 trapping. Results showed that the adsorption of pesticides differed significantly according to (i) the type of molecule, (ii) the type of CC, (iii) the degree of CC decomposition and the interaction CC??decomposition time. EPX and GLY were the most (Kd ranging from 188 to 267Lkg-1) and the least (Kd ranging from 18 to 28Lkg-1) sorbed pesticides respectively. With increasing decomposition of the CC residue, sorption increased by 1.6- to 4.7-fold according to the type of pesticide and cover crop. It was significantly correlated with the net cumulative mineralization (??{\textgreater}0.7) and other indicators of biochemical composition such as C:N ratio (??{\textless}-0.7), the Van Soest neutral detergent soluble fraction (??{\textgreater}0.5) and the alkyl/O-alkyl C ratio determined by NMR.

abstract = {Despite empirical evidence that infiltration plays an important role in controlling the transfer of chemicals from soil to surface runoff, few mechanistic models have been tested under both infiltrating and non-infiltrating conditions. We used previously published experimental data to test a physically-based, solute transport model. The model's underlying conceptual basis is that near-surface soil chemicals are ejected into runoff by raindrop impact and chemicals deeper in the soil diffuse into this near-surface raindrop “exchange-layer.” The experiments consisted of three soil types (clay, loam, and fine sandy loam) subjected to three infiltration conditions (none, full drainage, and reduced infiltration). Model parameters that could not be directly determined from the descriptions of the experiments were determined from previously published information or otherwise internally constrained. The model's governing equations were solved numerically and the results agreed well with measured solute concentrations in both runoff and soil-water for all the experiments. The results emphasize the potentially important role of saturated, poorly draining parts of the landscape in contributing solutes to streams and lakes via overland flow.},

Some of the problems of distributed modelling are discussed including the problem of nonlinearity, the problem of scale, the problem of equifinality, the problem of uniqueness and the problem of uncertainty. A structure for the application of distributed modelling is suggested based on an uncertain or fuzzy landscape space to model space mapping. This is suggested as the basis for an Alternative Blueprint for distributed modelling in the form of an application methodology. This Alternative Blueprint is scientific in that it allows for the formulation of testable hypotheses. It focuses attention on the prior evaluation of models in terms of physical realism and on the value of data in model rejection. Finally, some unresolved questions that distributed modelling must address in the future are outlined, together with a vision for distributed modelling as a means of learning about places},

abstract = {Field-scale pesticide leaching risk assessments were performed by incorporating a numerical, one-dimensional, water and pesticide transport and fate model into the two-step stochastic modeling approach by Loll and Moldrup 1998. The numerical model included first-order pesticide degradation, linear equilibrium adsorption, and plant uptake of water and pesticide. Simazine was used as a model pesticide, and leaching risk was expressed as the cumulative mass fraction of applied pesticide leached below 100 cm after 1 year. Spatial variability in soil physical and biochemical data, as well as measured meteorological data from an average and a relatively wet year, was considered for two Danish held sites: (1) a coarse sandy soil, with relatively small variability in hydraulic properties, and (2) a sandy loam, with large variability in hydraulic properties. The two-step stochastic modeling approach was used to investigate the relative impact of spatial variability in saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s, soil-water retention through the Campbell 1974 soil-water retention parameter b, and pesticide sorption through the organic carbon content (OC). For the coarse sandy soil, field- scale spatial variability in OC was the single most important parameter influencing leaching risk, whereas for the sandy loam, K-s was found more important than OC. The relative impact of field-scale spatial variability in these parameters was found independent of the meteorological conditions, whereas the absolute level of leaching risk was highly dependent on the meteorological conditions. Assuming a linear dependency between pesticide half-life and OC, a unified approach to modeling simultaneous field-scale variability in biodegradation and adsorption was proposed. Leaching risk assessments based on this approach showed that the parts of the field with both low biological activity and low adsorption capacity contributed with a dramatic increase in leaching risk, and suggested that field-scale spatial variability in biochemical processes can be of similar or larger importance than both hydraulic properties and meteorological conditions},

abstract = {The oxidative degradation of organic matter is a key process in the biogeochemical functioning of the earth system. Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This work extends the simple experimental studies initiated by Heilig et al. [J. Hydrol. 244(2001) 9] to study erosion processes inherent to a mechanistic soil erosion model (the Rose model) that were not addressed in earlier studies. Specifically, we investigated the impacts of ponding water depth and soil detachability on erosion. The Rose model describes the interplay among the processes of soil detachment, transport, deposition, and redetachment, which are involved in rain-induced soil erosion and sediment transport. The simple experiment that was used to improve our understanding of how water-ponding and soil detachability affect soil erosion utilized a small, horizontal, uniform, soil surface exposed to uniform, simulated rainfall. Rainfall rates were systematically changed between 6 and 48 mm h-1. Soil detachability was associated with a clay soil prepared at two different water contents. The Rose model was applied to the experimental conditions and the predicted erosion behavior was compared to experimental measurements. Observed data compared very well with the model results. The experimentally observed relationship between ponding water depth and soil detachability agreed well with previously proposed theories; soil detachability was constant for ponding depths below a critical depth and dramatically decreased above the critical depth. Also, these experiments corroborated that the soil detachability as represented in the Rose model is independent of rain intensity. These results provide support to the validity of the Rose model with respect to the roles of surface water-ponding and its relationship to soil detachability. These mechanisms can be incorporated into models of more complicated and realistic systems in which these individual processes may be difficult to explicitly identify. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

To determine the removal efficiency and key factors limiting wetland N removal, N fluxes were studied in a small constructed wetland in Central Switzerland. With an isotope mass balance approach integrating the natural isotope signature of nitrate (NO 3 -), ammonium (NH 4 +), and particulate nitrogen (PN), the N transformations such as assimilation, mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification were quantified. On average, the wetland removed 45 g m -2 yr -1 N during the studied 2.5 years, corresponding to a removal efficiency of 27{\%}. Denitrification contributed 94{\%} to the N removal, while only 6{\%} of the removed N accumulated in the sediments. Denitrification was most efficient during periods with an oxic water column overlying anoxic sediments, as NH 4 + released during mineralization of sediment organic matter was completely nitrified and subsequently denitrified at the sediment-water interface. During water column anoxia, NH 4 + accumulated in the water and fueled assimilation by duckweed and internal recycling. The NO 3 -N isotope signature in the wetland mainly reflected the mineralization of sediment organic matter and subsequent nitrification, while denitrification at the sediment-water interface produced no fractionation.},

Herbicide runoff was monitored from a month before application through harvest.

Results demonstrated that volatilization losses for these two herbicides were significantly greater than runoff losses ( {\textless} 0.007), even though both have relatively low vapor pressures. The largest annual runoff loss for metolachlor never exceeded 2.5{\%}, whereas atrazine runoff never exceeded 3{\%} of that applied. On the other hand, herbicide cumulative volatilization losses after 5 d ranged from about 5 to 63{\%} of that applied for metolachlor and about 2 to 12{\%} of that applied for atrazine. Additionally, daytime herbicide volatilization losses were significantly greater than nighttime vapor losses ( {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Convincing experimental evidence suggests increased sorption of pesticides on soil over time, which, so far, has not been considered in the regulatory assessment of leaching to groundwater. Recently, Beulke and van Beinum (2012) proposed a guidance on how to conduct, analyse and use time-dependent sorption studies in pesticide registration. The applicability of the recommended experimental set-up and fitting procedure was examined for two fungicides, penflufen and fluxapyroxad, in four soils during a 170 day incubation experiment. RESULTS: The apparent distribution coefficient increased by a factor of 2.5–4.5 for penflufen and by a factor of 2.5–2.8 for fluxapyroxad. The recommended two-site, one-rate sorption model adequately described measurements of total mass and liquid phase concentration in the calcium chloride suspension and the calculated apparent distribution coefficient, passing all prescribed quality criteria for model fit and parameter reliability. CONCLUSION: The guidance is technically mature regarding the experimental set-up and parameterisation of the sorption model for the two moderately mobile and relatively persistent fungicides under investigation. These parameters can be used for transport modelling in soil, thereby recognising the existence of the experimentally observed, but in the regulatory leaching assessment of pesticides not yet routinely considered phenomenon of time-dependent sorption. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has, in combination with model-assisted interpretation, proven to be a valuable approach to quantify the extent of organic contaminant degradation in groundwater systems. CSIA data may also provide insights into the origin and transformation of diffuse pollutants, such as pesticides and nitrate, at the catchment scale. While CSIA methods for pesticides have increasingly become available, they have not yet been deployed to interpret isotope data of pesticides in surface water. We applied a coupled subsurface-surface reactive transport model (HydroGeoSphere) at the hillslope scale to investigate the usefulness of CSIA in the assessment of pesticide degradation. We simulated the transport and transformation of a pesticide in a hypothetical but realistic two-dimensional hillslope transect. The steady-state model results illustrate a strong increase of isotope ratios at the hillslope outlet, which resulted from degradation and long travel times through the hillslope during average hydrological conditions. In contrast, following an extreme rainfall event that induced overland flow, the simulated isotope ratios dropped to the values of soil water in the pesticide application area. These results suggest that CSIA can help to identify rainfall-runoff events that entail significant pesticide transport to the stream via surface runoff. Simulations with daily rainfall and evapotranspiration data and one pesticide application per year resulted in small seasonal variations of concentrations and isotope ratios at the hillslope outlet, which fell within the uncertainty range of current CSIA methods. This implies a good reliability of in-stream isotope data in the absence of transport via surface runoff or other fast transport routes, since the time of measurement appears to be of minor importance for the assessment of pesticide degradation. The analysis of simulated isotope ratios also allowed quantification of the contribution of two different reaction pathways (aerobic and anaerobic) to overall degradation, which gave further insight into the transport routes in the modelled system. The simulations supported the use of the commonly applied Rayleigh equation for the interpretation of CSIA data, since this led to an underestimation of the real extent of degradation of less than 12{\%} at the hillslope outlet. Overall, this study emphasizes the applicability and usefulness of CSIA in the assessment of diffuse river pollution, and represents a first step towards a theoretical framework for the interpretation of CSIA data in agricultural catchments.},

The first order bulk attenuation rate constant for o-xylene was calculated to be 0.0025??d- 1 and a novel stable isotope-based first order model, which also accounted for the respective redox conditions, resulted in a slightly smaller biodegradation rate constant of 0.0019??d- 1. Based on MM-kinetics, the o-xylene concentration decreased with a maximum rate of kmax = 0.1????g/L/d. The bulk attenuation rate constant of naphthalene retrieved from the classical first order decay model was 0.0038??d- 1. The stable isotope-based biodegradation rate constant of 0.0027??d- 1 was smaller in the reduced zone, while residual naphthalene in the oxic part of the plume further downgradient was degraded at a higher rate of 0.0038??d- 1. With MM-kinetics a maximum degradation rate of kmax = 12????g/L/d was determined. Although best fits were obtained by MM-kinetics, we consider the carbon stable isotope-based approach more appropriate as it is specific for biodegradation (not overall attenuation) and at the same time accounts for the dominant electron-accepting process. For o-xylene a field based isotope enrichment factor ??field of - 1.4 could be determined using the Rayleigh model, which closely matched values from laboratory studies of o-xylene degradation under sulfate-reducing conditions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Vertical flow systems filled with porous medium have been shown to efficiently remove volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) from contaminated groundwater. To apply this semi-natural remediation strategy it is however necessary to distinguish between removal due to biodegradation and due to volatile losses to the atmosphere. Especially for (potentially) toxic VOCs, the latter needs to be minimized to limit atmospheric emissions. In this study, numerical simulation was used to investigate quantitatively the removal of volatile organic compounds in two pilot-scale water treatment systems: an unplanted vertical flow filter and a planted one, which could also be called a vertical flow constructed wetland, both used for the treatment of contaminated groundwater. These systems were intermittently loaded with contaminated water containing benzene and MTBE as main VOCs. The highly dynamic but permanently unsaturated conditions in the porous medium facilitated aerobic biodegradation but could lead to volatile emissions of the contaminants. Experimental data from porous material analyses, flow rate measurements, solute tracer and gas tracer test, as well as contaminant concentration measurements at the boundaries of the systems were used to constrain a numerical reactive transport modeling approach. Numerical simulations considered unsaturated water flow, transport of species in the aqueous and the gas phase as well as aerobic degradation processes, which made it possible to quantify the rates of biodegradation and volatile emissions and calculating their contribution to total contaminant removal. A range of degradation rates was determined using experimental results of both systems under two operation modes and validated by field data obtained at different operation modes applied to the filters. For both filters, simulations and experimental data point to high biodegradation rates, if the flow filters have had time to build up their removal capacity. For this case volatile emissions are negligible and total removal can be attributed to biodegradation, only. The simulation study thus supports the use of both of these vertical flow systems for the treatment of groundwater contaminated with VOCs and the use of reactive transport modeling for the assessment of VOCs removal and operation modes in these high performance treatment systems.},

abstract = {The Rayleigh equation is frequently used to describe isotope fractionation as a function of conversion. In this article we propose to draw a parallel between isotope and enantiomeric enrichments and derive a set of conditions that allow the use of the Rayleigh approach to describe the enantiomeric enrichment-conversion dependencies. We demonstrate an implementation of the Rayleigh equation for the enantioselective enzymatic hydrolysis of Mecoprop-methyl, Dichlorprop-methyl, and dimethyl-methylsuccinate by lipases from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Candida rugosa. The data obtained for all the studied reactions gave good fits to the Rayleigh equation, with a linear regression R(2) {\textgreater} 0.96. In addition to that, our analysis of four microcosm studies on the hydrolysis of the individual enantiomers of Dichloroprop methyl, Lactofen, Fenoxaprop-ethyl, and Metalaxyl reported in the literature by other research groups revealed a suitability of the Rayleigh dependence. Two dimensional plots describing the isotope fractionation versus enantiomeric enrichment are demonstrated for all studied cases. Processes not accompanied by enantiomeric enrichment (acid and base hydrolysis) and by isotope enrichment (transesterification) are demonstrated, their 2-D plots are either horizontal or vertical which can illuminate concealed degradation pathways.},

abstract = {Hydrolysis of a pesticide is basically a reaction with a water molecule involving specific catalysis by proton or hydroxide, and sometimes inorganic ions such as phosphate ion, present in the aquatic environment that play a role in general acid-base catalysis. In this review, the basic profiles of hydrolysis such as pH and temperature dependencies are clarified for each class of pesticides together with typical reaction mechanisms. Although these hydrolytic profiles depend on the chemical structure and functional group(s) of a pesticide molecule, they are not always consistent within a chemical class of pesticides. For example, organophosphorus pesticides are primarily susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis with less acidic catalysis, but some of phosphorodithioates are found to be acid labile. In the case of carbamates, the pKa value of a leaving group is known to control their hydrolysis mechanism, whether BAC2 or E1cB. As one of the predictive approaches, the linear free-energy relationship has been successfully applied to hydrolysis of a series of organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides under conditions in which the reaction mechanism does not change. However, it still seems advantageous to estimate a priori hydrolytic profiles of pesticides, either because there is insufficient precision in the methodology or the chemical class is limited, or because of pH and temperature dependencies of hydrolysis. Therefore, it would still be practical, for the present, when investigating abiotic hydrolysis of a new pesticide that a laboratory study be effectively designed on the basis of accumulated knowledge of hydrolytic profiles for the essential chemical structure and functional groups and conducted to obtain pH- and temperature-rate profiles. Various instrumental techniques have been applied to chemical identification of degradates, leading to clarification of the reaction mechanisms involved, but greater use of computational methods such as ab initio and semiempirical molecular orbital calculations would be highly recommended for better understanding at a molecular level by considering the solvent effect (hydration). The chemical identification of degradates is usually cumbersome and challenging, especially when these are unstable species. The recent progress of LC-MS allows unstable or polar degradates to be identified more efficiently, and such knowledge will help researchers to hydrolytic processes more easily understand. Although testing guidelines being harmonized throughout the world afford valuable information on the basic profiles of hydrolysis, recent investigations on interactions of pesticides with dissolved organic matter and catalytic or inhibitive effects caused by metal ions, metal oxides, and clay seem to raise the question as to what degree laboratory and field data differ and how laboratory data can be more precisely extrapolated to field data. Moreover, pesticides are usually applied as a suitable formulation, and thus the effects of surfactants and other formulation reagents on hydrolysis should be examined in more detail. To assess the fate and impact of pesticides and their degradates in real aquatic environments, these concerns should be further examined using the various analytical techniques together with simulation models.},

abstract = {Wetlands improve water quality through denitrification, but these ecosystems are also an important source of the greenhouse gas, methane. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of two common macrophyte species ( Juncus effusus and Salix nigra ) on denitrification and on the methane cycle. The research was conducted in a newly constructed wetland on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University during two growing seasons. In the wetland, some plots were left unplanted, while others were planted with Salix or Juncus species (i.e., 3 treatments; n = 15 per treatment). For each treatment, we quantified concentrations of methane at two depths (15 and 25 cm) in the sediment, emissions of methane from the sediment and through the plants, and denitrification rates. During most of the second growing season, both species had a limited effect on denitrification and methanogenesis. The effects of the plants became evident by the end of the second growing season and during the third growing season. During the third growing season, Salix species enhanced the release of the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere, while Juncus limited the emission of methane. In comparison to the unplanted plots, the long-term removal of nitrate by denitrification was favored in the plots planted with Juncus and was not affected by Salix . Our study provides evidence that certain plants (such as Juncus ) can be planted in constructed wetlands to favor denitrification, while buffering methane emission.},

abstract = {Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, DE) has been the location of an in-depth study by the RTDF (Remediation Technologies Development Forum Bioremediation of Chlorinated Solvents Action Team) to evaluate the effectiveness of natural attenuation of chlorinated ethene contamination in groundwater. Compound-specific stable carbon isotope measurements for dissolved PCE and TCE in wells distributed throughout the anaerobic portion of the plume confirm that stable carbon isotope values are isotopically enriched in 13C consistent with the effects of intrinsic biodegradation. During anaerobic microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons, the light (12C) versus heavy isotope (13C) bonds are preferentially degraded, resulting in isotopic enrichment of the residual contaminant in 13C. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide definitive evidence for reductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons at a field site based on the delta13C values of the primary contaminants spilled at the site, PCE and TCE. For TCE, downgradient wells show delta13C values as enriched as -18.0/1000 as compared to delta13C values for TCE in the source zone of -25.0 to -26.0/1000. The most enriched delta13C value on the site was observed at well 236, which also contains the highest concentrations of cis-DCE, VC, and ethene, the daughter products of reductive dechlorination. Stable carbon isotope signatures are used to quantify the relative extent of biodegradation between zones of the contaminant plume. On the basis of this approach, it is estimated that TCE in downgradient well 236 is more than 40{\%} biodegraded relative to TCE in the proposed source area.},

abstract = {Polaromonas sp. strain JS666 is the only bacterial isolate capable of using cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) as a sole carbon and energy source. Studies of cDCE degradation in this novel organism are of interest because of potential bioremediation and biocatalysis applications. The primary cellular responses of JS666 to growth on cDCE were explored using proteomics and transcriptomics to identify the genes upregulated by cDCE. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed upregulation of genes annotated as encoding glutathione S-transferase, cyclohexanone monooxygenase, and haloacid dehalogenase. DNA microarray experiments confirmed the proteomics findings that the genes indicated above were among the most highly upregulated by cDCE. The upregulation of genes with antioxidant functions and the inhibition of cDCE degradation by elevated oxygen levels suggest that cDCE induces an oxidative stress response. Furthermore, the upregulation of a predicted ABC transporter and two sodium/solute symporters suggests that transport is important in cDCE degradation. The omics data were integrated with data from compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and biochemical experiments to develop a hypothesis for cDCE degradation pathways in JS666. The CSIA results indicate that the measured isotope enrichment factors for aerobic cDCE degradation ranged from -17.4 to -22.4 per thousand. Evidence suggests that cDCE degradation via monooxygenase-catalyzed epoxidation (C C cleavage) may be only a minor degradation pathway under the conditions of these experiments and that the major degradation pathway involves carbon-chloride cleavage as the initial step, a novel mechanism. The results provide a significant step toward elucidation of cDCE degradation pathways and enhanced understanding of cDCE degradation in JS666.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes are often used as natural labels to quantify the contributions of multiple sources to a mixture. For example, C and N isotopic signatures can be used to determine the fraction of three food sources in a consumer's diet. The standard dual isotope, three source linear mixing model assumes that the proportional contribution of a source to a mixture is the same for both elements (e.g., C, N). This may be a reasonable assumption if the concentrations are similar among all sources. However, one source is often particularly rich or poor in one element (e.g., N), which logically leads to a proportionate increase or decrease in the contribution of that source to the mixture for that element relative to the other element (e.g., C). We have developed a concentration-weighted linear mixing model, which assumes that for each element, a source's contribution is proportional to the contributed mass times the elemental concentration in that source. The model is outlined for two elements and three sources, but can be generalized to n elements and n+1 sources. Sensitivity analyses for C and N in three sources indicated that varying the N concentration of just one source had large and differing effects on the estimated source contributions of mass, C, and N. The same was true for a case study of bears feeding on salmon, moose, and N-poor plants. In this example, the estimated biomass contribution of salmon from the concentration-weighted model was markedly less than the standard model estimate. Application of the model to a captive feeding study of captive mink fed on salmon, lean beef, and C-rich, N-poor beef fat reproduced very closely the known dietary proportions, whereas the standard model failed to yield a set of positive source proportions. Use of this concentration-weighted model is recommended whenever the elemental concentrations vary substantially among the Sources'. which may occur in a variety of ecological and geochemical applications of stable isotope analysis. Possible examples besides dietary and food web Studies include stable isotope analysis of water Sources in soils, plants, or water bodies; geological Sources for soils or marine systems, decomposition and soil organic matter dynamics. and tracing animal migration patterns. A spreadsheet for performing the calculations for this model is available at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven beneficial in the characterization of contaminant degradation in groundwater, but it has never been used to assess pesticide transformation at catchment scale. This study presents concentration and carbon CSIA data of the herbicides S-metolachlor and acetochlor from three locations (plot, drain, and catchment outlets) in a 47-ha agricultural catchment (Bas-Rhin France). Herbicide concentrations at the catchment outlet were highest (62{\&}thinsp;{\&}mu;g{\&}thinsp;L{\&}minus;1) in response to an intense rainfall event following herbicide application. Increasing {\&}delta;13C-values of S-metolachlor and acetochlor by more than 2{\&}thinsp;{\&}permil; during the study period indicated herbicide degradation. To assist the interpretation of these data, discharge, concentrations and {\&}delta;13C-values of S-metolachlor were modelled with a conceptual mathematical model using the transport formulation by travel time distributions. Testing of different model setups supported the assumption that degradation half-lives (DT50) increase with increasing soil depth, which can be straightforwardly implemented in conceptual models using travel time distributions. Moreover, model calibration yielded an estimate of a field-integrated isotopic enrichment factor as opposed to laboratory-based assessments of enrichment factors in closed systems. Thirdly, the Rayleigh equation commonly applied in groundwater studies was tested by our model for its potential to quantify degradation at catchment scale. It provided conservative estimates on the extent of degradation as occurred in stream samples. However, largely exceeding the simulated degradation within the entire catchment, these estimates were not representative of overall degradation at catchment scale. The conceptual modelling approach thus enabled us to upscale sample-based CSIA information on degradation to the catchment scale. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefit of combining monitoring and conceptual modelling of concentrations and CSIA data, and advocates the use of travel time distributions for assessing pesticide fate and transport at catchment scale.},

abstract = {Pesticide biodegradation is a soil microbial function of critical importance for modern agriculture and its environmental impact. While it was once assumed that this activity was homogeneously distributed at the field scale, mounting evidence indicates that this is rarely the case. Here, we critically examine the literature on spatial variability of pesticide biodegradation in agricultural soil. We discuss the motivations, methods, and main findings of the primary literature. We found significant diversity in the approaches used to describe and quantify spatial heterogeneity, which complicates inter-studies comparisons. However, it is clear that the presence and activity of pesticide degraders is often highly spatially variable with coefficients of variation often exceeding 50{\%} and frequently displays non-random spatial patterns. A few controlling factors have tentatively been identified across pesticide classes: they include some soil characteristics (pH) and some agricultural management practices (pesticide application, tillage), while other potential controlling factors have more conflicting effects depending on the site or the pesticide. Evidence demonstrating the importance of spatial heterogeneity on the fate of pesticides in soil has been difficult to obtain but modeling and experimental systems that do not include soil's full complexity reveal that this heterogeneity must be considered to improve prediction of pesticide biodegradation rates or of leaching risks. Overall, studying the spatial heterogeneity of pesticide biodegradation is a relatively new field at the interface of agronomy, microbial ecology, and geosciences and a wealth of novel data is being collected from these different disciplinary perspectives. We make suggestions on possible avenues to take full advantage of these investigations for a better understanding and prediction of the fate of pesticides in soil.},

abstract = {Most vegetated land surfaces contain macropores that may have a significant effect on the rate of infiltration of water under ponded conditions on the ground surface. Owing to the small-scale variations of the land topography (microtopography), only portions of the land area may get ponded during the process of overland flow. As the macropores transmit water at much higher rates than the primary soil matrix, higher macropore activation in ponded areas produces larger effective infiltration rates into the soil. Therefore, overland flow and infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone are interrelated. Representing the microtopographic variation of the land surface by a simple sine wave function, a method was developed to relate the ponding area to the average ponding depth which was determined by overland flow. A numerical model coupling overland flow and infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone was developed. Overland flow was simulated using the St. Venant equations with the inertia terms neglected. A single macropore model was used to simulate the infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone. The interaction between overland flow and the infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone was analyzed for a hypothetical watershed. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the interaction of macropore flow and overland flow is significant. For the conditions tested, the macropore flow and the overland flow were found to be more sensitive to the macroporosity and less sensitive to the microtopographic surface variation.},

abstract = {The study investigated carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation during aerobic oxidation and reductive dechlorination of vinyl chloride (VC) and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). The experimental data followed a Rayleigh trend. For aerobic oxidation, the average carbon isotope enrichment factors were -7.2 per thousand and -8.5{\%} for VC and cDCE, respectively, while average chlorine isotope enrichment factors were only -0.3 per thousand for both compounds. These values are consistent with an initial transformation by epoxidation for which a significant primary carbon isotope effect and only a small secondary chlorine isotope effect is expected. For reductive dechlorination, larger carbon isotope enrichment factors of -25.2 per thousand for VC and -18.5 per thousand for cDCE were observed consistent with previous studies. Although the average chlorine isotope enrichmentfactors were larger than those of aerobic oxidation (-1.8 per thousand for VC, -1.5 per thousand for cDCE), they were not as large as typically expected for a primary chlorine isotope effect suggesting that no cleavage of C-Cl bonds takes place during the initial rate-limiting step. The ratio of isotope enrichment factors for chlorine and carbon were substantially different for the two reaction mechanisms suggesting that the reaction mechanisms can be differentiated at the field scale using a dual isotope approach.},

abstract = {During rain events, herbicides can be transported from their point of application to surface waters, where they may harm aquatic organisms. Since the spatial pattern of mo- bilisation and transport is heterogeneous, the contributions of different fields to the herbicide load in the stream may vary considerably within one catchment. Therefore, the pre- diction of contributing areas could help to target mitigation measures efficiently to those locations where they reduce her- bicide pollution the most. Such spatial predictions require sufficient insight into the underlying transport processes. To improve the understand- ing of the process chain of herbicide mobilisation on the field and the subsequent transport through the catchment to the stream, we performed a controlled herbicide application on corn fields in a small agricultural catchment (ca. 1km2) with intensive crop production in the Swiss Plateau. Water samples were collected at different locations in the catch- ment (overland flow, tile drains and open channel) for two months after application in 2009, with a high temporal reso- lution during rain events.We also analysed soil samples from the experimental fields and measured discharge, groundwa- ter level, soil moisture and the occurrence of overland flow at several locations. Several rain events with varying intensi- ties and magnitudes occurred during the study period. Over- land flow and erosion were frequently observed in the entire catchment. Infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow were both observed. However, the main herbicide loss event was dominated by infiltration excess. Despite the frequent and wide-spread occurrence of over- land flow, most of this water did not reach the channel di- rectly, butwas retained in small depressions in the catchment. From there, it reached the stream via macropores and tile drains. Manholes of the drainage system and storm drains for road and farmyard runoff acted as additional shortcuts to the stream. Although fast flow processes such as overland and macro- pore flow reduce the influence of the herbicide's chemical properties on transport due to short travel times, sorption properties influenced the herbicide transfer from ponding overland flow to tile drains (macropore flow). However, no influence of sorption was observed during the mobilisation of the herbicides from soil to overland flow. These observa- tions on the role of herbicide properties contradict previous findings to some degree. Furthermore, they demonstrate that valuable insight can be gained by making spatially detailed observations along the flow paths. 1},

Monitoring of target pesticides, metabolites and tracers in drainage water made apparent the significant role of preferential flow in the mobility of the studied compounds through the soil and the vadose zone during the first days after herbicides application. The detection of metabolites in drainage water confirmed herbicides degradation once higher residence times in the soil zone where achieved. An efficient preconcentration procedure was developed for 10-L drainage water samples to achieve enough analyte enrichment for C, N and Cl isotope ratios measurements. Methods for isotope analyses are currently being developed and the applicability of CSIA for assessing the in situ biodegradation of the target pesticides during transport in soil and vadose zone will be evaluated.

Experiments were conducted hydroponically utilizing 14C-labeled compounds to ascertain translocation and fate. Predictive relationships for the translocation and partitioning to plant tissues were developed from the experimental data. Translocation and partitioning relationships based on compounds' octanol?water partitioning coefficients (log Kow) produced the best results, but the relationships did not allow for fully accurate prediction of each contaminant's fate. Translocation and subsequent transpiration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the leaves to the atmosphere was shown to be a significant pathway. As full-scale phytoremediation systems are deliberated, the pathways investigated here should be considered in terms of a contaminant removal mechanism and potential contamination of the vegetation.},

abstract = {We revealed a history of legacy pesticides in water and sediment samples from 19 small streams across an agricultural landscape. Dominant legacy compounds included organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT and lindane, the organophosphate chlorpyrifos and triazine herbicides such as terbutylazine and simazine which have long been banned in the EU. The highest concentrations of legacy pesticides were found in streams draining catchments with a large proportion of arable farmland suggesting that they originated from past agricultural applications. The sum of toxic units (SumTU{\textless}inf{\textgreater}D.magna{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) based on storm water samples from agriculturally impacted streams was significantly higher when legacy pesticides were included compared to when they were omitted. Legacy pesticides did not significantly change the predicted toxicity of water samples to algae or fish. However, pesticide concentrations in bed sediment and suspended sediment samples exceeded safety thresholds in 50{\%} of the samples and the average contribution of legacy pesticides to the SumTU{\textless}inf{\textgreater}C.riparius{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was {\textgreater}90{\%}. Our results suggest that legacy pesticides can be highly significant contributors to the current toxic exposure of stream biota, especially macroinvertebrate communities, and that those communities were primarily exposed to legacy pesticides via the sediment. Additionally, our results suggest that neglecting legacy pesticides in the risk assessment of pesticides in streams may severely underestimate the risk of ecological effects.},

abstract = {Quantitative information regarding the capacity of rivers to self-purify pharmaceutical residues is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present a methodology for quantifying the governing processes affecting the fate of pharmaceuticals in streaming waters and, especially, to evaluate their relative significance for tracer observations. A tracer test in S??va Brook, Sweden was evaluated using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model framework containing surface water transport together with a representation of transient storage in slow/immobile zones of the stream, which are presumably important for the retention and attenuation of pharmaceuticals. To assess the key processes affecting the environmental fate of the compounds, we linked the uncertainty estimates of the reaction rate coefficients to the relative influence of transformation and sorption that occurred in different stream environments. The hydrological and biogeochemical contributions to the fate of the pharmaceuticals were decoupled, and the results indicate a moderate hydrological retention in the hyporheic zone as well as in the densely vegetated parts of the stream. Biogeochemical reactions in these transient storage zones further affected the fate of the pharmaceuticals, and we found that sorption was the key process for bezafibrate, metoprolol, and naproxen, while primary transformation was the most important process for clofibric acid and ibuprofen. Conversely, diclofenac was not affected by sorption or transformation. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) serves as a tool for source apportionment (SA) and for the quantification of the extent of degradation (QED) of organic pollutants. However, simultaneous occurrence of mixing of sources and degradation is generally believed to hamper both SA and QED. On the basis of the linear stable isotope mixing model and the Rayleigh equation, we developed the stable isotope sources and sinks model, which allows for simultaneous SA and QED of a pollutant that is emitted by two sources and degrades via one transformation process. It was shown that the model necessitates at least dual-element CSIA for unequivocal SA in the presence of degradation-induced isotope fractionation, as illustrated for perchlorate in groundwater. The model also enables QED, provided degradation follows instantaneous mixing of two sources. If mixing occurs after two sources have degraded separately, the model can still provide a conservative estimate of the overall extent of degradation. The model can be extended to a larger number of sources and sinks as outlined. It may aid in forensics and natural attenuation assessment of soil, groundwater, surface water, or atmospheric pollution.},

abstract = {The assessment of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers has become an issue of increasing importance in the recent years. To some extent, this can be related to the acceptance of intrinsic bioremediation or monitored natural attenuation as a means to manage contaminated sites. Among the few existing methods to detect biodegradation in the subsurface, stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) is one of the most promising approaches which is pronounced by the drastically increasing number of applications. This review covers the recent laboratory and field studies assessing biodegradation of contaminants via stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope enrichment factors have been found that vary from no fractionation for dioxygenase reactions converting aromatic hydrocarbons over moderate fractionation by monooxygenase reactions (??=-3???) and some anaerobic studies on microbial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (??=-1.7???) to larger fractionations by anaerobic dehalogenation reactions of chlorinated solvents (??=between -5??? and -30???). The different isotope enrichment factors can be related to the respective biochemical reactions. Based on that knowledge, we discuss under what circumstances SIFA can be used for a qualitative or even a quantitative assessment of biodegradation in the environment. In a steadily increasing number of cases, it was possible to explain biodegradation processes in the field based on isotope enrichment factors obtained from laboratory experiments with pure cultures and measured isotope values from the field. The review will focus on the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents as the major contaminants of groundwater. Advances in the instrumental development for stable isotope analysis are only mentioned if it is important for the understanding of the application. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Single-rate transport models are commonly used for interpreting sorption-related mass transfer in porous media, often with the intention of approximating the kinetics of the sorption process. Among the most commonly used single-rate models are the two-site first-order (TSFO) and the two-site radial diffusion (TSRD) models. We fitted the parameters of the TSFO and TSRD models to simulated breakthrough data of hypothetical column experiments in which sorption rates were described by a $\gamma$-distributed sorption sites (GS) model. Our objective was to determine the conditions under which the assumption of a single-rate sorption parameter will be applicable to systems with heterogeneous sorption rates. We were further interested in knowing in what manner the fitted single-rate nonequilibrium model parameters depend upon the conditions under which the data were obtained. The considered hypothetical cases covered a range of experimental conditions and involved compounds with different sorption characteristics. The study revealed that the goodness of fit of the single rate models in simulating the transport of solutes exhibiting heterogeneous sorption rates is affected by solute residence time and pulse injection duration. Compared to the TSFO model, the TSRD model generally results in better prediction of solute transport affected by heterogeneous sorption kinetics. In addition, for such systems, the nonequilibrium parameters fitted using the TSFO model and their counterparts in the TSRD model are highly correlated. Moreover, an increase in the fitted mass transfer timescale of each of the single-rate models is coupled with an increase in the associated fraction of instantaneous sorption sites. A strong correlation was found between the time of the experiment and the product of the fitted characteristic time for mass transfer, pulse duration, and solute residence time. The correlation explains many of the variations in the mass transfer timescale encountered when single-rate sorption approaches were utilized to model solute transport in previous miscible displacement studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For carbon surplus conditions (carbon:sulphate of 2.8:1) sulphate reduction happened but was repressed, in contrast to unplanted filters mentioned in literature. Doubling the carbon load caused stable and efficient sulphate reduction, rising of pH, increasing enrichment of S2- and S0 in pore water, and finally plant death and inhibition of nitrification by sulphide toxicity.

abstract = {Mapping the extent of hydrocarbon spills in Antarctica is commonly done by hand sampling of active layer soils and by mechanical coring deeper into the frozen layer. While these methods provide reliable results, the act of obtaining samples can cause almost as much damage to the site as the contamination. A nondestructive, noninvasive method to map extent of hydrocarbon (JP5, JP8) spills on dry permafrost would provide a more environmentally sound contaminated site management tool. This study provides a base knowledge of how noninvasive nondestructive geophysical surveying can be used to map hydrocarbon spills in an Antarctic permafrost setting, and establishes its suitability as a tool for environmental monitoring at Antarctic bases. Geophysical surveys were undertaken at Scott Base, Antarctica, using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and the EM31??? horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) instrument. Surveys were carried out over the same location before and after the summer melt. Areas known to be hydrocarbon-contaminated appeared as resistive anomalies using an EM31. Variations in the geophysical response between surveys were found, with conductivities increasing, on average, by a factor of two for the late summer, but resistive anomalies persisted. GPR was not successful in direct detection of contaminated ground; however, it did provide valuable information on the nature of the subsurface which is useful to predict future movement of contaminants. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Although both raindrop driven processes and diffusion play important roles in the transfer of chemicals from soil to surface runoff, current transport models either do not consider the two processes together, or use `effective' parameters with uncertain physical definitions. We developed a physically based, solute transport model that couples both mechanisms and tested it with laboratory experiments. One unique aspect of this study is that all the parameters were either directly measured or previously published, that is, there was no model `calibration' or `fitting.' Our model assumes that chemicals near the surface of the soil are ejected into runoff by raindrop impact and chemicals deeper in the soil diffuse into a surface layer, or `exchange layer,' via diffusion. The exchange layer depth and transfer processes are derived from the `shield' concept in the Rose soil erosion model (e.g. Rose, 1985). The model's governing equations were solved numerically and the results agreed well with experimental data (R2{\textgreater}0.90). The model's sensitivity to various physical and chemical parameters illuminated the importance of both raindrop controlled processes and diffusion on chemical transport from soil to surface runoff.},

We summarize recent advances from laboratory studies, review current limitations and analytical challenges associated with low concentrations and high polarity of micropollutants, and delineate the potential of micropolluant CSIA for field applications. We highlight future challenges and prospects regarding source apportionment, identification of biotic and abiotic transformation reactions on a mechanistic level, as well as integrative evaluation of degradation hot spots on the catchment scale.

abstract = {Organic chemicals can contribute to local and regional losses of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, their overall relevance regarding larger spatial scales remains unknown. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first risk assessment of organic chemicals on the continental scale comprising 4,000 European monitoring sites. Organic chemicals were likely to exert acute lethal and chronic long-term effects on sensitive fish, invertebrate, or algae species in 14{\%} and 42{\%} of the sites, respectively. Of the 223 chemicals monitored, pesticides, tributyltin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and brominated flame retardants were the major contributors to the chemical risk. Their presence was related to agricultural and urban areas in the upstream catchment. The risk of potential acute lethal and chronic long-term effects increased with the number of ecotoxicologically relevant chemicals analyzed at each site. As most monitoring programs considered in this study only included a subset of these chemicals, our assessment likely underestimates the actual risk. Increasing chemical risk was associated with deterioration in the quality status of fish and invertebrate communities. Our results clearly indicate that chemical pollution is a large-scale environmental problem and requires far-reaching, holistic mitigation measures to preserve and restore ecosystem health.},

abstract = {Ecosystems that function as critical transition zones (CTZs) among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats are closely connected to the ecosystems adjacent to them and are characterized by a rapid flux of materials and organisms. CTZs play various roles, including mediating water flows, accumulating sediments and organic matter, processing nutrients, and providing opportunities for recreation. They are particularly difficult to manage because they tend to be small, albeit important, components of large watersheds, and managers may not have control over the entire landscape. Moreover, they are often the focus of intensive human activity. Consequently, CTZs are critically important zones, and their preservation and protection are likely to require unique collaboration among scientists, managers, and stakeholders. Scientists can learn a great deal from the study of these ecosystems, taking advantage of small size and the importance of fluxes, but a good understanding of adaptive management strategies is needed to establish a dialogue with managers and stakeholders on technical and management issues. An understanding of risk analysis is also important to help set meaningful goals and establish logical strategies that include all of the interested parties. Successful restoration of a CTZ is the best test of the quality of knowledge about its structure and function. Much has already been learned about coastal CTZs through restoration projects, and the large number of such projects involving riparian CTZs in particular suggests that there is considerable opportunity for fruitful collaborations between scientists and managers.},

Metolachlor adsorption to a heavy soil (Terra-Rosa) was predominately to the clay minerals and oxides. Metolachlor release from a heavy soil subjected to WDCs was higher than its release from the soil not subjected to WDCs. Consequently, a bioassay in soil columns treated with the commercial formulation indicated enhanced metolachlor leaching in heavy soils under WDCs. In contrast, when metolachlor was applied as the CRF, leaching was suppressed and not affected by WDCs. These results emphasize the advantages of the CRF also in heavy soils subjected to WDCs.},

abstract = {Understanding herbicide sorption within soil profiles is the first step to predicting their behavior and leaching potential. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the influence of surface and subsurface soil properties on acetochlor, atrazine, and S-metolachlor sorption. Soil samples were taken from horizons A, B, and C of two loamy soils of the humid pampas of Argentina under no-till management; horizon A was divided into two layers, A(0) (0-5 cm) and A(1) (5 cm to the full thickness of an A horizon). Sorption isotherms were determined from each sampled horizon using the batch equilibrium method and seven concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg L(-1) ). Sorption affinity of herbicides was approximated by the Freundlich equation. The sorption strength K(f) (mg(1 - 1/n) kg(-1) L(1/n) ) over the soils and horizons studied followed the order S-metolachlor (16.51-29.19) {\textgreater} atrazine (4.85-12.34) ≥ acetochlor (5.17-11.97), which was closely related to the hydrophobicity of herbicides expressed as octanol-water partition coefficient (K(OW) ). The K(f) values of the three herbicides were positively correlated with soil organic carbon, with a significance of p {\textless} 0.01. Values of K(f) for the three herbicides decreased with depth in the two soils, indicating greater sorption onto surficial soil horizons and possibly a delayed transport toward subsurface soils and subsequent pollution of groundwater.

abstract = {In a large area around the former open-pit lignite mines near Bitterfeld, Germany, groundwater taken from wells was analyzed for the major cations, anions, and trace elements. Quaternary and Tertiary sediments were collected from aquifers exposed on the sides of the pits and from boreholes outside the mines and analyzed for major and trace elements, as well as for carbonate, pyritic sulfur and total organic carbon. The pH and electrical conductivity of the sediments in suspension were measured. Significant differences were determined between the Tertiary sediments of the aquifers that were exposed to atmospheric oxygen during the lowering of the groundwater table and those outside the cone of depression. The greatest differences were found in the pyrite content, the pH values, and the electrical conductivity. In order to map the degree to which the mining of the lignite has affected the quality of the groundwater in the study area, the water samples were divided into six classes on the basis of their sulfate content. The neutralization potential was calculated to estimate the potential for acidification. Prediction of future groundwater quality is based on both (i) the present composition of the groundwater, surface water, and Quaternary and Tertiary aquifer sediments and (ii) the present and future groundwater flow directions. These studies have shown which parameters are important for future groundwater monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A dual-isotope and solute flux mass-balance was used to elucidate the processes that lead to attenuation of nitrogen contamination in an agriculturally impacted river. The River Wensum drains a lowland catchment with an area of 570 km² in East Anglia, eastern England. Analysis of nitrate concentration, $\delta$¹⁵N(NO₃) and $\delta$¹⁸O(NO₃) of samples from the River Wensum collected from upstream locations to the catchment outlet through all seasons and flow conditions showed a consistent pattern of increasing isotope values with decreasing nitrate concentrations downstream. $\delta$¹⁵N(NO₃) and $\delta$¹⁸O(NO₃) of catchment surface water and groundwater samples revealed a dominant influence from microbially cycled and nitrified source-nitrogen, which results in high nitrate concentrations in Chalk groundwater and upstream in the River Wensum. Denitrification of Chalk groundwater-baseflow in the hyporheic zone results in the downstream trend observed in the river. Hyporheic denitrification is estimated to remove 931 kg/day of nitrate-nitrogen by the catchment outlet, representing 31{\%} of the potential riverine nitrate load. The use of dual-isotope and solute flux modeling at the catchment scale is a novel application to quantify denitrification within the river valley, demonstrating the importance of hyporheic zone processes in attenuating the impacts of anthropogenic contamination of hydrologic systems.},

abstract = {A portable Wavelength Scanned-Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (Picarro L2120) fitted with a diffusion sampler (DS-CRDS) was used for the first time to continuously measure $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H of stream water. The experiment took place during a storm event in a wet tropical agricultural catchment in north-eastern Australia. At a temporal resolution of one minute, the DS-CRDS measured 2160 $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H values continuously over a period of 36 h with a precision of ±0.08 and 0.5‰ for $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H, respectively. Four main advantages in using high temporal resolution stream $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H data during a storm event are highlighted from this study. First, they enabled us to separate components of the hydrograph, which was not possible using high temporal resolution electrical conductivity data that represented changes in solute transfers during the storm event rather than physical hydrological processes. The results from the hydrograph separation confirm fast groundwater contribution to the stream, with the first 5 h of increases in stream discharge comprising over 70{\%} pre-event water. Second, the high temporal resolution stream $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H data allowed us to detect a short-lived reversal in stream isotopic values ($\delta$18O increase by 0.4‰ over 9 min), which was observed immediately after the heavy rainfall period. Third, $\delta$18O values were used to calculate a time lag of 20 min between the physical and chemical stream responses during the storm event. Finally, the hydrograph separation highlights the role of event waters in the runoff transfers of herbicides and nutrients from this heavily cultivated catchment to the Great Barrier Reef.

Total organic carbon content of root extracts ranged from 103 to 395 mg l(-1). Characterization of root extracts identified acetate (not detectable to 8.0 mg l(-1)), amino acids (1.7-17.3 mg l(-1)) and glucose (1.6-14.0 mg l(-1)), indicating a complex mixture of substrates. Repression was also observed after exposure to potential root-derived substrates, including organic acids, glucose (carbohydrate) and glutamate (amino acid). Carbon source regulation (e.g. catabolite repression) was apparently responsible for the observed repression of P. putida PDA by root extracts. However, we showed that P. putida grows on root extracts and exudates as sole carbon and energy sources. Enhanced growth on root products may compensate for partial repression, because larger microbial populations are conducive to faster degradation rates. This would explain the commonly reported increase in phenanthrene removal in the rhizosphere.},

Given this large number of indicators and models, the choice is difficult for potential users. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-criteria analysis applied to ten existing tools including physically based and conceptual models, indicators and multi-agent systems. We found the following major points: (1) Indicators and conceptual models are the most popular approaches to assess the transfer of pesticides to surface water at the catchment scale due to a trade-off between environmental relevance and adaptation to users needs. (2) The latest indicators developed are inferred from the results of conceptual or physically based models to combine the strengths of each approach. (3) Only a handful of physically based models have addressed both flow and pesticide transport at the catchment as affected by the internal heterogeneity of the system. However, it is only physically based models that can simulate the impact of changes to the catchment. Physically based models integrate feedbacks between hydrological and chemical processes not possible from conceptual models or indicators alone. (4) The ability of models to assess the pesticide loads both in the dissolved and particulate phases is a key issue not properly addressed by many indicators or models. A key way forward is the integration of erosion processes with the fate of pesticide adsorbed to these particles. (5) At the catchment, the hydrological connectivity is perhaps the primary hydrological variable required to correctly assess rapid flow processes as surface runoff and associated pesticide transfer. This in turn implies using tools that explicitly represent the connectedness of surface and/or sub-surface water pathways including mitigation measures to correctly assess the risk of pesticide transfer.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope fractionation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) during biodegradation by Microbacterium sp. strain BR1 (ipso-hydroxylation) and upon direct photolysis was investigated. Carbon isotope signatures ($\delta$(13)C) of SMX were measured by LC-IRMS (liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry). A new LC-IRMS method for the SMX metabolite, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (3A5MI), was established. Carbon isotope enrichment factors for SMX ($\epsilon$C) were -0.6 ± 0.1‰ for biodegradation and -2.0 ± 0.1‰ and -3.0 ± 0.2‰ for direct photolysis, at pH 7.4 and pH 5, respectively. The corresponding apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIE) for ipso-hydroxylation were 1.006 ± 0.001; these fall in the same range as AKIE in previously studied hydroxylation reactions. The differences in SMX and 3A5MI fractionation upon biotic and abiotic degradation suggest that compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) is a suitable method to distinguish SMX reaction pathways. In addition, the study revealed that the extent of isotope fractionation during SMX photolytic cleavage is pH-dependent.},

abstract = {Horizontal flow constructed wetlands are engineered systems capable of eliminating a wide range of pollutants from the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, poor hydrodynamic behavior is commonly found resulting in preferential pathways and variations in both (i) the hydraulic residence time distribution (HRTD) and, consequently, (ii) the wetland's treatment efficiency. The aim of this work was to outline a methodology for wetland design that accounts for the effect of heterogeneous hydraulic properties of the porous substrate on the HRTD and treatment efficiency. Biodegradation of benzene was used to illustrate the influence of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on wetland efficiency. Random, spatially correlated hydraulic conductivity fields following a log-normal distribution were generated and then introduced in a subsurface flow numerical model. The results showed that the variance of the distribution and the correlation length in the longitudinal direction are key indicators of the extent of heterogeneity. A reduction of the mean hydraulic residence time was observed as the extent of heterogeneity increased, while the HRTD became broader with increased skewness. At the same time, substrate heterogeneity induced preferential flow paths within the wetland bed resulting in variations of the benzene treatment efficiency. Further to this it was observed that the distribution of biomass within the porous bed became heterogeneous, rising questions on the representativeness of sampling. It was concluded that traditional methods for wetland design based on assumptions such as a homogeneous porous medium and plug flow are not reliable. The alternative design methodology presented here is based on the incorporation of heterogeneity directly during the design phase. The same methodology can also be used to optimize existing systems, where the HRTD has been characterized with tracer experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Diffuse losses from agricultural fields are a major input source for herbicides in surface waters. In this and in a companion paper, we present the results of a comprehensive field study aimed at assessing the overall loss dynamics of three model herbicides (i.e., atrazine, dimethenamid, and metolachlor) from a small agricultural catchment (2.1 km2) and evaluating the relative contributions of various fields having different soil and topographical characteristics. An identical mixture of the three model herbicides as well as an additional pesticide for identification of a given field were applied within 12 h on 13 cornfields (total area approximately 12 ha), thus ensuring that the herbicides were exposed to identical meteorological conditions. After the simultaneous application, the concentrations of the compounds were monitored in the soils and at the outlets of three subcatchments containing between 4 and 5 cornfields each. Particular emphasis was placed on the two rain events that led to the major losses of the herbicides. The rank orders of herbicide dissipation in the soils and of the compound-specific mobilization into runoff were the same in all three subcatchments and were independent of the field characteristics. In contrast, the field properties caused the relative losses from two subcatchments to differ by up to a factor of 56 during the most important event, whereas compound-specific differences of the three neutral herbicides caused the losses to vary only by a factor of 2 during the same event. The enormous spatial variability was mainly caused by factors influencing the fraction of rain that was lost to surface water by fast transport mechanisms. Thus, the key factors determining the spatially variable herbicide losses were the permeability of the soils, the topography, and the location of subsurface drainage systems. These results illustrate the large potential to reduce herbicide losses by avoiding application on risk areas.},

abstract = {A number of processes contribute to the decrease in solute concentration in the near surface; these include leaching and degradation. The combined effect of all loss processes is termed dissipation; its converse is termed persistence. In this paper we derive analytical expressions for the statistics of the time for a chemical, which undergoes linear equilibrium sorption and first-order degradation under the influence of a random series of rainfall events, to dissipate to a specified concentration. Rainfall is characterized by a random time between events and a random storm depth, both of which are assumed to be exponentially distributed. Analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the time for dissipation to 50{\%} (DT50) and 10{\%} (DT90) of the applied concentration are derived. The model is in qualitative agreement with empirical observations of pesticide dissipation. The model results indicate that on average these solutes tend to dissipate exponentially with time. Rapid dissipation initially, followed by slower dissipation later, is more likely to occur. This may contribute to observations of apparent multirate dissipation which can be explained without recourse to sorption or biological kinetics. A larger average storm magnitude and/or more frequent storms reduce the mean and increase the coefficient of variation of dissipation times. A normal distribution, parameterized using the derived statistics, approximated the probability distribution of dissipation times reasonably well. On the basis of this we obtain a measure of the potential amount of chemical available for rapid off-site leaching at a given time since application.},

abstract = {Surface runoff and erosion during the course of rainfall events are major processes of pesticides transport from agricultural land to aquatic ecosystem. These processes are generally evaluated either at the plot or the catchment scale. Here, we compared at both scales the transport and partitioning in runoff water of two widely used fungicides, i.e., kresoxim-methyl (KM) and cyazofamid (CY). The objective was to evaluate the relationship between fungicides runoff from the plot and from the vineyard catchment. The results show that seasonal exports for KM and CY at the catchment were larger than those obtained at the plot. This underlines that non-target areas within the catchment largely contribute to the overall load of runoff-associated fungicides. Estimations show that 85 and 62 {\%} of the loads observed for KM and CY at the catchment outlet cannot be explained by the vineyard plots. However, the partitioning of KM and CY between three fractions, i.e., the suspended solids ({\textgreater} 0.7 mu m) and two dissolved fractions (i.e., between 0.22 and 0.7 A mu m and {\textless} 0.22 A mu m) in runoff water was similar at both scales. KM was predominantly detected below 0.22 mu m, whereas CY was mainly detected in the fraction between 0.22 and 0.7 mu m. Although KM and CY have similar physicochemical properties and are expected to behave similarly, our results show that their partitioning between two fractions of the dissolved phase differs largely. It is concluded that combined observations of pesticide runoff at both the catchment and the plot scales enable to evaluate the sources areas of pesticide off-site transport.},

abstract = {There are currently no industry-wide standards for the calibration and specification of water-level monitoring pressure transducers. Consequently, specifications from different manufacturers are currently not directly comparable, and different branded sensors may not perform similarly under the same environmental conditions. This has been highlighted by the varied performance of 14 leading brands of pressure transducers under test conditions. In laboratory tests, transducers generally met product accuracy specifications, although temperature compensation was substandard in five absolute sensors. In a 99-day field test, accuracy was typically within around ±10 mm for lower range pressure sensors, which exceeded some product specifications. Furthermore, there was evidence for linear and curved forms of instrument drift. As a result of the diverse performance of the transducers, it is recommended that an industry-wide standard for calibration and specification is introduced. This would eliminate any uncertainty surrounding the current procedures and lead to more informed procurement by the user who would have a greater understanding of comparative instrument performance. Any new standard should also address sensor drift which is currently rarely cited in product specifications.},

@article{Haws2006,
abstract = {Bioavailability often controls the fate of organic contaminants in surface and subsurface aquatic environments. Bioavailability can be limited by sorption, mass transfer, and intrinsic biodegradation potential and can be further altered by the presence of other compounds. This paper reviews current perspectives on the processes influencing subsurface contaminant bioavailability, how these processes are modeled, and how the relative role of the various processes can be assessed through bioavailability indices. Although these processes are increasingly well understood, the use of sophisticated models and indices often are precluded by an inability to estimate the many parameters that are associated with complex models. Nonetheless, the proper representation of sorption, mass transfer, biodegradation, and co-solute effects can be critical in predicting bio-attenuation. The influence of these processes on contaminant fate is illustrated with numerical simulations for the simultaneous degradation of toluene (growth substrate) and trichloroethylene (nongrowth cometabolite) in hypothetical, aerobic, solid-water systems. The results show how the relative impacts on contaminant fate of the model's various component processes depends upon system conditions, including co-solute concentrations. Slow biodegradation rates increase the inhibition effects of a cometabolite and suppress the rate enhancement effects of a growth substrate. Irrespective of co-solute effects, contaminant fate is less sensitive to biodegradation processes in systems with strong sorption and slow desorption rates. Bioavailability indices can be used to relate these findings and to help identify appropriate modeling simplifications. In general, however, there remains a need to redefine such indices in order that bioavailability concepts can be better incorporated into site characterization, remediation design, and regulatory oversight. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm, dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. DDS is designed for calibration problems with many parameters, requires no algorithm parameter tuning, and automatically scales the search to find good solutions within the maximum number of user-specified function (or model) evaluations. As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15–20{\%} of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework.},

abstract = {Natural attenuation is presently used at numerous sites where groundwater is contaminated. In order to simulate this attenuation, reactive transport models are often used but they are quite complex and depend on both physical and chemical conditions in the aquifer. As complex numerical models cannot be used to study all possible cases, we develop here analytical solutions to draw general conclusions. Our strategy, called MIKSS (Mixed Instantaneous and Kinetics Superposition Sequence), allows the calculation of the concentrations of all reacting substances in a plume. It is an extension of the superimposition principle that is able to treat the case of joint kinetics and instantaneous reactions. The basic equations have been extended to treat different reactions that occur in the plume core and at its fringe. At first we consider one organic substance degraded under all oxidising conditions (toluene for instance). For this problem the size of the plume depends on the reduced source width and on the ratio of the organic substance concentration to the sum of the electron acceptors' concentrations. For several BTEX substances having different degradation behaviour the formulation is similar, but leads to quite different plume lengths for each substance. Contrary to the case of one substance, the plumes can be quite long and may not satisfy the target risk level. For chlorinated solvents we developed a specific approach to take under consideration all reactions and particularly the competition for hydrogen. A formula is given to assess the size of the plume core, i.e. the zone with highly reducing conditions. The factors influencing the core length are the same as for BTEX (source width, dispersivity, organic carbon content). The size of the TCE plume is calculated from the plume core length and the kinetic constant of TCE degradation. Using assumptions of degradation constants for DCE and VC it is also possible to calculate the longitudinal concentration profile of these substances. The degradation of moderately substituted solvents under oxic conditions reduces the size of their plumes but under these conditions TCE becomes the major threat. Among the conditions studied in this paper, very few chlorinated solvents sites can lead to a negligible risk at an acceptable distance from the source. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Traditional concepts of nutrient uptake and growth kinetics as linked by cell yield are presented. Phenomena affecting the kinetics are examined along with a discussion of those which lead to ambiguity. Concepts of flux control are presented to help understand the distribution of material along metabolic pathways. Specific affinity is described to relate nutrient accumulation rates to transporter density. It is shown to be a primary kinetic constant and the best available index of nutrient collection ability. As an aid to understanding, specific affinity is reexpressed in terms of membrane permeability. Formulations of nutrient transport rate as a function of cellular composition, particularly transporter and enzyme content and known as janusian kinetics, are described as an improvement to specific affinity theory. Procedures for quantified unidirectional fluxes are reviewed to identify the difference between gross and net transport rates of substrate. Collision frequency theory is used to show that in addition to total biomass, cell size and transporter density should also be included in rate equations describing microbial growth. Theory diversity suggests that one reason for microbial metabolic is that the likelihood of additional collisions of substrate molecules with a cell surface, after an initial collision, requires only a sparse distribution of transporter sites for maximal rate, leaving room for additional transporters able to collect other substrate types.},

These equations, presented here with the name GEBIK (general equations for biochemical isotope kinetics) and GEBIF (general equations for biochemical isotope fractionation), take into account microbial biomass and enzyme dynamics, reaction stoichiometry, isotope substitution number, and isotope location within each isotopologue and isotopomer. In addition to solving the complete GEBIK and GEBIF, we also present and discuss two approximations to the full solutions under the assumption of biomass-free and enzyme steady-state, and under the quasi-steady-state assumption as applied to the complexation rate. The complete and approximate approaches are applied to observations of biological denitrification in soils. Our analysis highlights that the full GEBIK and GEBIF provide a more accurate description of concentrations and isotopic compositions of substrates and products throughout the reaction than do the approximate forms. We demonstrate that the isotopic effects of a biochemical reaction depend, in the most general case, on substrate and complex concentrations and, therefore, the fractionation factor is a function of time. We also demonstrate that inverse isotopic effects can occur for values of the fractionation factor smaller than 1, and that reactions that do not discriminate isotopes do not necessarily imply a fractionation factor equal to 1. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The 7 billion global population is projected to grow by 70 million per annum, increasing by 30 {\%} to 9.2 billion by 2050. This increased population density is projected to increase demand for food production by 70{\%}notably due to changes in dietary habits in developing countries towards high quality food, e.g. greater consumption of meat and milk products and to the increasing use of grains for livestock feed. The availability of additional agricultural land is limited. Any expansion will happen mostly at the expense of forests and the natural habitats containing wildlife, wild relatives of crops and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, more agricultural land will be used to produce bio-based commodities such as biofuel or fibre instead of food. Thus, we need to grow food on even less land, with less water, using less energy, fertiliser and pesticide than we use today. Given these limitations, sustainable production at elevated levels is urgently needed. The reduction of current yield losses caused by pests is a major challenge to agricultural production. This review presents (1) worldwide crop losses due to pests, (2) estimates of pesticide-related productivity, and costs and benefits of pesticide use, (3) approaches to reduce yield losses by chemical, as well as biological and recombinant methods of pest control and (4) the challenges of the cropprotection industry. The general public has a critical function in determining the future role of pesticides in agriculture. However, as long as there is a demand for pesticide-based solutions to pest control problems and food security concerns, the externality problems associated with the human and environmental health effects of pesticides need also to be addressed.},

abstract = {A model-based analysis of concentration and isotope data was carried out to assess natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in an aerobic fractured bedrock aquifer. Tetrachloroethene (PCE) concentrations decreased downgradient of the source, but constant delta13C signatures indicated the absence of PCE degradation. In contrast, geochemical and isotopic data demonstrated degradation of trichloroethene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) under the prevailing oxic conditions. Numerical modeling was employed to simulate isotopic enrichment of chlorinated ethenes and to evaluate alternative degradation pathway scenarios. Existing field information on groundwater flow, solute transport, geochemistry, and delta13C signatures of the chlorinated ethenes was integrated via reactive transport simulations. The results provided strong evidence for the occurrence of aerobic TCE and DCE degradation. The chlorinated ethene concentrations together with stable carbon isotope data allowed us to reliably constrain the assessment of the extent of biodegradation at the site and plume simulations quantitatively linked aerobic biodegradation with isotope signatures in the field. Our investigation provides the first quantitative assessment of aerobic biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes in a fractured rock aquifer based on compound specific stable isotope measurements and reactive transport modeling.},

The objective of this laboratory experiment was to compare the mineralisation of atrazine andmetolachlor with that of their respectivemetabolites in VFS and cultivated soil.With the exception of total bacteria, propagule density of the microbial groups, endogenous soil enzymes and microbial diversity were higher in the VFS soil. This correlated with increased mineralisation of metolachlor and itsmetabolites in the VFS soil and indicates potential for VFS to curtail the subsequent transport of these compounds. In contrast, the mineralisation of atrazine and the majority of its metabolites was substantially reduced in VFS soil relative to cultivated soil. Consequently, the potential for subsequent transport of atrazine and many of its metabolites may be greater in VFS soil than in cultivated soil if reduced mineralisation is not offset by increased sorption in the VFS.},

abstract = {Compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) has become an important tool in biological, archeological, and geological studies as well as in forensics, food sciences, and organic chemistry. If sensitivity could be enhanced, CSIA would further have an improved potential for environmental applications such as, for example, in situ remediation studies to assess contaminated environments, identification of pollutant degradation pathways and kinetics, distinction between degradation/formation mechanisms, or, verification of contaminant sources. With this goal in mind, we have developed methods to determine ?a{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C values of commonly reported groundwater contaminants in low-microgram per liter concentrations. Several injection and preconcentration techniques were evaluated for this purpose, i.e., on-column injection, split/splitless injection, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and purge and trap (P{\&}T) in combination with gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The ?{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C values of the target compounds were determined by liquid injections of the analytes dissolved in diethyl ether or, in the case of P{\&}T and SPME, by extraction from water spiked with the analytes. P{\&}T extraction was the most efficient preconcentration technique reaching method detection limits (MDLs) from 0.25 to 5.0 ?g/L. These are the lowest MDLs reported so far for continuous-flow isotope ratio determinations, using a commercially available and fully automated system. Isotopic fractionation resulting from preconcentration and injection was investigated and quantified for the priority groundwater pollutants methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), chloroform, tetrachloromethane, chlorinated ethylenes, benzene, and toluene. The isotopic fractionations caused by the extraction techniques were small but highly reproducible and could therefore be corrected for. P{\&}T was characterized by a higher reproducibility and smaller isotopic fractionations than SPME. Among the liquid injection techniques, cold on-column injection resulted in slightly better precision compared to split/splitless injection. However, the MDLs determined for liquid injections were 4-6 orders of magnitude higher (i.e., 9.5-2800 mg/L) than for P{\&}T and SPME. Since both of the latter methods are solventless, a better chromatographic resolution was obtained than for the liquid injection techniques. The P{\&}T and SPME methods described here are also applicable for CSIA of D/H ratios, which require 10-20 times higher analyte concentrations than {\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}12{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C analysis. Finally, the applicability of the described methods is demonstrated for pollutant concentrations of only 5-60 ?g/L in environmental samples},

abstract = {Prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, almost all increases in crop and animal production occurred as a result of increases in the area cultivated. By the end of the century, almost all increases were coming from increases in land productivity—in output per acre or per hectare. This was an exceedingly short period in which to make a transition from a natural resource- based to a science-based system of agricultural production. In the presently devel- oped countries, the beginning of this transition began in the latter half of the nineteenth century. In most developing countries, the transition did not begin until well into the second half of the twentieth century. For some of the poorest countries in the world, the transition has not yet begun. During the second half of the twentieth century, world population more than doubled—from approximately 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6.0 billion in 2000. The demands placed on global agricultural production arising out of population and income growth almost tripled. By 2050, world population is projected to grow to between 9 and 10 billion people. Most of the growth is expected to occur in poor countries, where the income elasticity of demand for food remains high. Even moderately high income growth, combined with projected population growth, could result in close to doubling the demands placed on the world's farmers by 2050 (Johnson, 2000; United Nations, 2001).},

abstract = {A popular method for the treatment of aquifers contaminated with chlorinated solvents is chemical oxidation based on the injection of potassium permanganate (KMnO4). Both the high density (1025??gL- 1) and reactivity of the treatment solution influence the fate of permanganate (MnO4) in the subsurface and affect the degree of contaminant treatment. The MIN3P multicomponent reactive transport code was enhanced to simulate permanganate-based remediation, to evaluate the pathways of MnO4 utilization, and to assess the role of density contrasts for the delivery of the treatment solution. The modified code (MIN3P-D) provides a direct coupling between density-dependent fluid flow, solute transport, contaminant treatment, and geochemical reactions. The model is used to simulate a field trial of TCE oxidation in a sandy aquifer that is underlain by an aquitard. Three-dimensional simulations are conducted for a coupled reactive system comprised of ten aqueous components, two mineral phases, TCE (dissolved, adsorbed, and NAPL), reactive organic matter, and including ion exchange reactions. Model parameters are constrained by literature data and a detailed data set from the field site under investigation. The general spatial and transient evolution in observed concentrations of the oxidant, dissolved TCE, and reaction products are adequately reproduced by the simulations. The model elucidates the important role of density-induced flow and transport on the distribution of the treatment solution into NAPL containing regions located at the aquifer-aquitard interface. Model results further suggest that reactions that do not directly affect the stability of MnO4 have a negligible effect on solution density and MnO4 delivery. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A model of root water extraction is proposed, in which a linear variation of extraction rate with depth is assumed. Five crops are chosen for simulation studies of the model, and soil moisture depletion under optimal conditions from different layers for each crop is calculated. Similar calculations are also made using the constant extraction rate model. Rooting depth is assumed to vary linearly with potential evapotranspiration for each crop during the vegetative phase. The calculated depletion patterns are compared with measured mean depletion patterns for each crop. It is shown that the constant extraction rate model results in large errors in the prediction of soil moisture depletion, while the proposed linear extraction rate model gives satisfactory results. Hypothetical depletion patterns predicted by the model in combination with a moisture tension-dependent sink term developed elsewhere are indicated. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Photodegradation is an abiotic process in the dissipation of pesticides where molecular excitation by absorption of light energy results in various organic reactions, or reactive oxygen species such as OH*, O3, and 1O2 specifically or nonspecifically oxidize the functional groups in a pesticide molecule. In the case of soil photolysis, the heterogeneity of soil together with soil properties varying with meteorological conditions makes photolytic processes difficult to understand. In contrast to solution photolysis, where light is attenuated by solid particles, both absorption and emission profiles of a pesticide are modified through interaction with soil components such as adsorption to clay minerals or solubilization to humic substances. Diffusion of a pesticide molecule results in heterogeneous concentration in soil, and either steric constraint or photoinduced generation of reactive species under the limited mobility sometimes modifies degradation mechanisms. Extensive investigations of meteorological effects on soil moisture and temperature as well as development of an elaborate testing chamber controlling these factors seems to provide better conditions for researchers to examine the photodegradation of pesticides on soil under conditions similar to the real environment. However, the mechanistic analysis of photodegradation has just begun, and there still remain many issues to be clarified. For example, how photoprocesses affect the electronic states of pesticide molecules on soil or how the reactive oxygen species are generated on soil via interaction with clay minerals and humic substances should be investigated in greater detail. From this standpoint, the application of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and usage or development of various probes to trap intermediate species is highly desired. Furthermore, only limited information is yet available on the reactions of pesticides on soil with atmospheric chemical species. For photodegradation on plants, the importance of an emission spectrum of the light source near its surface was clarified. Most photochemical information comes from photolysis in organic solvents or on glass surfaces and/or plant metabolism studies. Epicuticular waxes may be approximated by long-chain hydrocarbons as a very viscous liquid or solid, but the existing form of pesticide molecules in waxes is still obscure. Either coexistence of formulation agents or steric constraint in the rigid medium would cause a change of molecular excitation, deactivation, and photodegradation mechanisms, which should be further investigated to understand the dissipation profiles of a pesticide in or on crops in the field. A thin-layer system with a coat of epicuticular waxes extracted from leaves or isolated cuticles has been utilized as a model, but its application has been very limited. There appear to be gaps in our knowledge about the surface chemistry and photochemistry of pesticides in both rigid media and plant metabolism. Photodegradation studies, for example, by using these models to eliminate contribution from metabolic conversion as much as possible, should be extensively conducted in conjunction with wax chemistry, with the controlling factors being clarified. As with soil surfaces, the effects of atmospheric oxidants should also be investigated. Based on this knowledge, new methods of kinetic analysis or a device simulating the fate of pesticides on these surfaces could be more rationally developed. Concerning soil photolysis, detailed mechanistic analysis of the mobility and fate of pesticides together with volatilization from soil surfaces has been initiated and its spatial distribution with time has been simulated with reasonable precision on a laboratory scale. Although mechanistic analyses have been conducted on penetration of pesticides through cuticular waxes, its combination with photodegradation to simulate the real environment is awaiting further investigation.},

Carbon isotope enrichment factors ($\epsilon$c) for $\gamma$-HCH ($\epsilon$c = -1.5 ± 0.1‰ and -1.7 ± 0.2‰) and $\alpha$-HCH ($\epsilon$c = -1.0 ± 0.2‰ and -1.6 ± 0.3‰) were similar for both aerobic strains, but lower in comparison with previously reported values for anaerobic $\gamma$- and $\alpha$-HCH degradation. Isotope fractionation of $\alpha$-HCH enantiomers was higher for (+) $\alpha$-HCH ($\epsilon$c = -2.4 ± 0.8 ‰ and -3.3 ± 0.8 ‰) in comparison to (-) $\alpha$-HCH ($\epsilon$c = -0.7 ± 0.2‰ and -1.0 ± 0.6‰).

The extent and range of isomer and enantiomeric carbon isotope fractionation of HCHs with Sphingobium spp. suggests that aerobic biodegradation of HCHs can be monitored in situ by compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) and enantiomer-specific isotope analysis (ESIA). In addition, enantiomeric fractionation has the potential as a complementary approach to CSIA and ESIA for assessing the biodegradation of $\alpha$-HCH at contaminated field sites.},

abstract = {To identify and quantify diffuse nitrate inputs into a river sub basin in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Germany) a dual-isotope approach with ??15N and ??18O in nitrate was carried out from October 2002 to March 2003. Three nitrate sources (water from artificially drained agricultural soils, groundwater, atmospheric deposition) and the river were sampled monthly to bimonthly. Nitrate of the drainage water had a concentration weighted mean (cwm) ??15N value of 10.4??? and ??18O of 4.7???, and was significantly different to the groundwater nitrate (cwm ??15N = 0.6???; ??18O = 1.4???). The low ??18O values indicated that most of the nitrate from these sources was formed during the nitrification process of soil organic N. Nitrate of atmospheric deposition had a cwm ??15N value of 0.1??? and a ??18O value of 51.7???. River nitrate showed cwm values of 9.0??? in ??15N and 6.0??? in ??18O close to the isotope values of the drainage water nitrate. The isotope values were used in a three source mixing-model, to determine the contribution of each sampled nitrate source to the total river nitrate. The mixing-model revealed that the nitrate from the drainage water contributed 86{\%} of the river nitrate. Contribution of nitrate from groundwater and atmospheric deposition was 11{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively. These results agree with estimations of nitrate input data for this sub basin given by a nutrient emissions model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Plant uptake is an important process in phytoremediation. The robust uptake of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by plants offers opportunities to establish quantitative relationships between VOCs in plant tissues and in groundwater for the purpose of phytoscreening or phytomonitoring. Most previous research pertaining to phytoremediation neglected the competitive effects of co-contaminants on the uptake of VOCs by plants, yet recent studies appeared to indicate high competitive effects of co-contamination. This study investigated the competitive uptake of three chlorinated compounds in the presence and absence of other co-contaminants by Redosier dogwood in a greenhouse and examined the implications of this competitive phenomenon for phytomonitoring of contaminant mixtures in groundwater. Concentrations of VOCs in stems decreased along the height in both single and bi-solute systems, in agreement with previous observations in the literature. Examination of the VOCs in single and bi-solute systems showed that concentrations of individual compounds are comparable in single and bi-solute systems, yet the ratios of contaminants along the height in bi-solute systems revealed interesting trends. TCE/PCE ratio increased along height while TCE/1,1,2-TCA ratio was roughly constant. The result indicated that sampling point as well as the physicochemical properties of co-contaminants is highly important in phytomonitoring of contaminant mixtures.},

abstract = {The enantioselective degradation of ibuprofen and naproxen enantiomers was evaluated in five different wastewater treatment systems, including three constructed wetlands (vertical- and horizontal-flow configurations), a sand filter and an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. In addition, injection experiments were carried out with racemic ibuprofen at microcosm- and pilot-scale constructed wetlands. Ibuprofen and naproxen have an asymmetric carbon atom and, consequently, two enantiomeric forms (i.e. S and R). The enantiomeric fraction (EF = S/(S + R)) in the raw sewage and effluents of various wastewater treatments were found to be compound-dependent (i.e. ibuprofen: EFinfluent = 0.73-0.90, EFeffluent = 0.60-0.76; naproxen: EFinfluent = 0.88-0.90, EFeffluent = 0.71-0.86). Of the two chiral pharmaceuticals, naproxen was the only one whose effluent EF correlated with its removal efficiency (p {\textless} 0.05). The lack of correlation found for ibuprofen was attributable to the fact that its enantioselective degradation kinetics were different under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Injection experiments of ibuprofen in constructed wetlands at microcosm and pilot-scale followed similar trends. Hence, under prevailing aerobic conditions, S-ibuprofen degraded faster than R-ibuprofen, whereas under prevailing anaerobic conditions, the degradation was not enantioselective. In summary, the naproxen EF measurements in wastewater effluents show that naproxen is a suitable alternative for evaluating the removal efficiency of treatment systems because its enantioselective degradation is similar under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Stable isotope data have been increasingly used to assess in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater. The data are usually evaluated using the Rayleigh equation to evaluate whether isotope data follow a Rayleigh trend, to calculate the extent of contaminant biodegradation, or to estimate first-order rate constants. However, the Rayleigh equation was developed for homogeneous systems while in the subsurface, contaminants can migrate at different velocities due to physical heterogeneity. This paper presents a method to quantify the systematic effect that is introduced by applying the Rayleigh equation to field isotope data. For this purpose, the travel time distribution between source and sampling point is characterized by an analytical solution to the advection-dispersion equation. The systematic effect was evaluated as a function of the magnitude of physical heterogeneity, geometry of the contaminant plume, and degree of biodegradation. Results revealed that the systematic effect always leads to an underestimation of the actual values of isotope enrichment factors, the extent of biodegradation, or first-order rate constants, especially in the dispersion-dominant region representing a higher degree of physical heterogeneity. A substantial systematic effect occurs especially for the quantification of first-order rate constants (up to 50{\%} underestimation of actual rate) while it is relatively small for quantification of the extent of biodegradation ({\textless} 5{\%} underestimation of actual degree of biodegradation). The magnitude of the systematic effect is in the same range as the uncertainty due to uncertainty of the analytical data, of the isotope enrichment factor, and the average travel time.},

abstract = {Stable chlorine isotope analysis is increasingly used to 9 characterize sources, transformation pathways, and sinks of organic 10 aliphatic compounds, many of them being priority pollutants in 11 groundwater and the atmosphere. A wider use of chlorine isotopes in 12 environmental studies is still inhibited by limitations of the different 13 analytical techniques such as high sample needs, offline preparation, 14 confinement to few compounds and mediocre precision, respectively. 15 Here we present a method for the $\delta$ 37 Cl determination in volatile aliphatic 16 compounds using gas chromatography coupled with multiple-collector 17 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-MC-ICPMS), which 18 overcomes these limitations. The method was evaluated by using a suite of 19 five previously offline characterized in-house standards and eight 20 chlorinated methanes, ethanes, and ethenes. Other than in previous approaches using ICP methods for chlorine isotopes, 21 isobaric interference of the 36 ArH dimer with 37 Cl was minimized by employing dry plasma conditions. Samples containing 2−3 22 nmol Cl injected on-column were sufficient to achieve a precision ($\sigma$) of 0.1 mUr (1 milliurey = 0.001 = 1‰) or better. Long-23 term reproducibility and accuracy was always better than 0.3 mUr if organics were analyzed in compound mixtures. 24 Standardization is carried out by using a two-point calibration approach. Drift, even though very small in this study, is corrected 25 by referencing versus an internal standard. The presented method offers a direct, universal, and compound-specific procedure to 26 measure the $\delta$ 37 Cl of a wide array of organic compounds overcoming limitations of previous techniques with the benefits of high 27 sensitivity and accuracy comparable to the best existing approaches. 28 C hlorinated organic compounds are ubiquitously distrib-29 uted in the environment. Many of these chemicals, 30 produced and emitted in large amounts in the past, are 31 considered priority pollutants due to their toxicity, persistence, 32 and adverse effects on climate and the stratospheric ozone 33 layer. 1,2 Apart from industrially manufactured organohalogens, 34 thousands of naturally produced compounds are released into 35 the environment. 3 Compound-specific stable isotope analysis 36 (CSIA) has become an indispensable tool in characterizing 37 sources, transformation paths, and sinks of organic compounds, 38 overcoming the limitation of solely quantifying concentration 39 levels. 4 Especially in the field of contaminant science, CSIA is 40 widely used to monitor degradation of chlorinated solvents, 41 BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) and other 42 pollutants in soils and groundwater. 5 43 To date the overarching majority of studies applied stable 44 carbon and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen isotope analyses to 45 study fate and transformation processes of these substances. 46 Publications presenting $\delta$ 37 Cl measurements are still few in 47 comparison to C and H isotope applications 6 even though first 48 chlorine isotope ratio determinations were carried out already 49 in the twenties and thirties of the last century. 7,8 Early 50 approaches, however, failed to determine isotopic differences in 51 minerals and rocks due to small fractionation and insufficient 52 instrumental precision of {\textgreater}1 mUr. 9 Significant differences in 53 natural inorganic samples were published by Kaufmann et al. in 54 1984 who presented a method with a precision of better than 55 0.24 mUr using dual inlet gas source isotope ratio mass 56 spectrometry (DI-IRMS). 10 Fractionation of chlorine isotopes 57 was first reported in organic compounds due to the larger 58 isotope effects. 11,12 Isotope ratio measurement of chlorinated 59 organics improved with the establishment of p-TIMS methods 60 (positive ion thermal ionization mass spectrometry) 13−15 and 61 offline conversion of organics to CH 3 Cl measured by DI-62 IRMS. 16,17 Later, online techniques for volatile chlorinated 63 organics were developed measuring fragments of molecules of 64 compounds such as trichloroethene, dichloroethene, and vinyl 65 chloride using GC-IRMS. 18,19 Other recent approaches 66 included, for instance, the application of gas chromatography 67 quadrupole mass spectrometry (GCqMS) 20,21 and online 68 conversion to HCl for isotope ratio determination via GC-69 IRMS.},

abstract = {The reactive transport model TBC (Transport, Biochemistry, and Chemistry) was applied to a laboratory column study on microbial organic carbon degradation by von Gunten and Zobrist [von Gunten, U., Zobrist, J., 1993. Biogeochemical changes in groundwater-infiltration systems: column studies, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 57 (1993) 3895-3906]. Five microbial groups were considered in the model: facultatively aerobic bacteria or denitrifiers, fermenters, and sulfate-, manganese-, and iron-reducers. By simulating their growth, subsequent consumption of organic carbon and electron acceptors, and production of metabolic products, it was possible to reproduce the observed transient concentration changes of the reactive species. Inhibition and availability of electron acceptors and/or organic carbon governed the transient growth behaviour of the different microbial groups. With the model the much slower growth of sulfate reducers compared to that of facultatively aerobic or denitrifying bacteria could be reproduced. To be able to reproduce the observed spatial sequence of different microbial groups a maximum microbial capacity had to be introduced. It restricts total microbial density in the porous material. Without this restriction the excessive organic substrate supply would have caused the microbial activity to be exclusively located at the immediate vicinity of the column inlet. The distribution of facultatively aerobic or denitrifying organisms and sulfate reducers in the column was determined by the exchange coefficient for the electron acceptor between pore water and biophase. The exchange of sulfate seemed to be much slower than that of O2 and NO3/-. The growth of manganese and iron reducers was limited by the availability of the solid electron acceptors Fe(III) and Mn(IV). The testing of two hypotheses concerning the interaction of iron and sulfide in the column suggests that the formation of elemental sulfur during abiotic reductive iron dissolution is an important sink for sulfide. The TBC model has proven to be complex enough to grasp the important reactive processes. The model provides a temporally and spatially resolved quantification of microbial degradation activity. It has shown to be a useful tool in testing alternative hypotheses on processes which could not directly be identified from the observed concentration data.},

abstract = {Temporal patterns of solute transport and transformation through the vadose zone are driven by the stochastic variability of water fluxes. This is determined by the hydrologic filtering of precipitation variability into infiltration, storage, drainage, and evapotranspiration. In this work we develop a framework for examining the role of the hydrologic filtering and, in particular, the effect of evapotranspiration in determining the travel time and delivery of sorbing, reacting solutes transported through the vadose zone by stochastic rainfall events. We describe a 1-D vertical model in which solute pulses are tracked as point loads transported to depth by a series of discrete infiltration events. Numerical solutions of this model compare well to the Richards equation–based HYDRUS model for some typical cases. We then utilize existing theory of the stochastic dynamics of soil water to derive analytical and semianalytical expressions for the probability density functions (pdf's) of solute travel time and delivery. The moments of these pdf's directly relate the mean and variance of expected travel times to the water balance and show how evapotranspiration tends to reduce (and make more uncertain) the mass of a degrading solute delivered to the base of the vadose zone. The framework suggests a classification of different modes hydrologic filtering depending on hydroclimatic and landscape controls. Results suggest that variability in travel times decreases with soil depth in wet climates but increases with soil depth in dry climates. In dry climates, rare large storms can be an important mechanism for leaching to groundwater.},

Soil cores were collected to measure fine root biomass$\backslash$nand to determine allometric relationships between root length and$\backslash$nbiomass. Significant seasonal variation of root dynamics was observed$\backslash$nin the young reference and restoration sites. The mature and intermediate-aged$\backslash$nsites exhibited little seasonal variability in root abundance and$\backslash$nmortality. Root production was variable but not seasonally consistent.$\backslash$nResults suggest that root dynamics become less seasonal as AWC communities$\backslash$nshift from herbaceous to woody vegetation dominance. No trend in$\backslash$nfine root abundance along the chronosequence was observed, suggesting$\backslash$nthat roots rapidly reestablish following tree harvest. Measurements$\backslash$nof annual root length production suggest increasing annual production$\backslash$nwith decreasing stand age. However, a reversal of this trend was$\backslash$nobserved when using production estimates calculated from minirhizotron$\backslash$nmeasurements and root length-mass relationships.

abstract = {An aerobic enrichment culture was grown on vinyl chloride (VC) as the sole source of carbon and energy. In the absence of VC, the enrichment culture cometabolized cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and, to a lesser extent, trans-1,2-dichloroethene (tDCE), beginning with oxidation to the corresponding DCE-epoxides. When provided with VC (1.3 mM) and cDCE (0.2?0.3 mM), the enrichment culture cometabolized repeated additions of cDCE for over 85 days. Cometabolism of repeated additions of tDCE was also demonstrated but at a lower ratio of nongrowth substrate to VC. VC-grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa MF1 (previously isolated from the enrichment culture) also readily cometabolizes cDCE, with an observed transformation capacity (Tc,obs) of 0.82 ?mol of cDCE/mg of total suspended solids (TSS). When provided with VC and cDCE, MF1 did not begin cometabolizing cDCE until nearly all of the VC was consumed. The presence of cDCE reduces the maximum specific rate of VC utilization. A kinetic model was developed that describes these phenomena via Monod parameters for substrate and nongrowth substrate, plus inactivation and inhibition coefficients. MF1 did not show any cometabolic activity on tDCE or trichloroethene and very limited activity on 1,1-DCE (Tc,obs = 2 ? 10-5 ?mol/mg TSS). Above 40 ?M, tDCE and TCE noticeably increased the maximum specific rate of VC utilization, even though neither compound was consumed during or after VC consumption. High concentrations of 1,1-DCE (950 ?M) completely inhibited VC biodegradation. As there is currently no evidence for aerobic biodegradation of cDCE as a sole source of carbon and energy, the results of this study provide a potential explanation for in situ disappearance of cDCE when the only other significant substrate available is VC. It is fortuitous that the VC-grown cultures tested exhibit their highest cometabolic activity toward cDCE, because it is the predominant DCE isomer formed during anaerobic reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene.},

abstract = {The application of compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) for evaluating degradation of organic pollutants in the field implies that other processes affecting pollutant concentration are minor with respect to isotope fractionation. Sorption is associated with minor isotope fractionation and pollutants may undergo successive sorption-desorption steps during their migration in aquifers. However, little is known about isotope fractionation of BTEX compounds after consecutive sorption steps. Here, we show that partitioning of benzene and toluene between water and organic sorbents (i.e. 1-octanol, dichloromethane, cyclohexane, hexanoic acid and Amberlite XAD-2) generally exhibits very small carbon and hydrogen isotope effects in multistep batch experiments. However, carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation was observed for the benzene-octanol pair after several sorption steps ($\delta$$\delta$13C=1.6±0.3‰ and $\delta$$\delta$2H=88±3‰), yielding isotope fractionation factors of $\alpha$C=1.0030±0.0005 and $\alpha$H=1.195±0.026. Our results indicate that the cumulative effect of successive hydrophobic partitioning steps in an aquifer generally results in insignificant isotope fractionation for benzene and toluene. However, significant carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation cannot be excluded for specific sorbate-sorbent pairs, such as sorbates with $\pi$-electrons and sorbents with OH-groups. Consequently, functional groups of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) may specifically interact with BTEX compounds migrating in an aquifer, thereby resulting in potentially relevant isotope fractionation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of wetlands as a bioremediation treatment technology for halogenated hydrocarbons has recently gained interest. However, the impact of biogeochemical dynamics over a wetland's life-span on contaminant removal remains poorly understood. Based on the results of a constructed wetland experiment, we established a reactive transport model (RTM) that includes the transition from oxidation to reductive dehalogenation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and corresponding carbon isotope signatures to quantify removal pathways in wetland environments. cDCE was removed during the entire life-span of the wetland despite significant changes in its biogeochemistry. Model results showed that during the oxic phase, 88{\%} of cDCE throughput was removed, with oxidative cDCE mineralization accounting for 53.3 mg m-2d-1(45{\%}) and carbon isotope enrichment factors ranging from eDCE-Oxid=-1 to - 4.0 ‰. During the anoxic phase, the wetland removed 85{\%} of cDCE mainly by volatilization and reductive dehalogenation $\epsilon$DCE-Dehal=-32 to -36‰, with the latter degrading 21.3 mg m-2d-1of cDCE (28{\%}) and producing 13.7 mg m-2d-1of vinyl chloride (VC). cDCE oxidation $\epsilon$DCE-Oxid=-9.4 to -11.5‰ accounted for only 9.1 mg m-2d-1(12{\%}). 4.4 mg m-2d-1of the VC produced in the wetland was biodegraded via oxidation (32{\%}), while 2.8 mg m-2d-1(20{\%}) was converted into non-toxic ethene via dehalogenation. Plant uptake of cDCE accounted for up to 23{\%} of the mass removal during the oxic phase and 16{\%} during the anoxic phase (6{\%} for VC). Altogether, the RTM enables a mechanistic representation and quantitative prediction of the fate of intermediate chloroethenes in redox-dynamic environments such as wetlands.},

abstract = {Pesticide volatilization is a significant loss pathway that may have unintended consequences in nontarget environments. Field-scale pesticide volatilization involves the interaction of a number of complex variables. There is a need to acquire pesticide volatilization fluxes from a location where several of these variables can be held constant. Accordingly, soil properties, tillage practices, surface residue management, and pesticide formulations were held constant while fundamental information regarding metolachlor volatilization (a pre-emergent pesticide) was monitored over a five-year period as influenced by meteorological variables and soil water content. Metolachlor vapor concentrations were measured continuously for 120 h after each application using polyurethane foam plugs in a logarithmic profile above the soil surface. A flux gradient technique was used to compute volatilization fluxes from metolachlor concentration profiles and turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor (as determined from eddy covariance measurements). Differences in meteorological conditions and surface soil water contents resulted in variability of the volatilization losses over the years studied. The peak volatilization losses for each year occurred during the first 24 h after application with a maximum flux rate in 2001 (1500 ng m(-2) s(-1)) associated with wet surface soil conditions combined with warm temperatures. The cumulative volatilization losses for the 120-hour period following metolachlor application varied over the years from 5 to 25{\%} of the applied active ingredient, with approximately 87{\%} of the losses occurring during the first 72 h. In all of the years studied, volatilization occurred diurnally and accounted for between 43 and 86{\%} during the day and 14 and 57{\%} during the night of the total measured loss. The results suggest that metolachlor volatilization is influenced by multiple factors involving meteorological, surface soil, and chemical factors.},

The submodel assumes two types of sorption sites: equilibrium sites and non-equilibrium sites. The sorption isotherms for bot sites are described with Freundlich equations. The content sorbed at the equilibrium site is assumed to be continuously at equilibrium and the content sorbed at the non-equilibrium site is described with a pseudo first-order sorption rate equation. The transformation rate in soil is assumed to be proportional to the amount in the liquid phase plus the amount sorbed at the equilibrium site. So the content sorbed at the non-equilibrium site is not subject to transformation. The mathematical equations describing the submodel are solved via a FORTRAN programme. An additional FORTRAN programme generates the necessary input files for the PEST optimisation package. Instructions are given how to obtain optimized parameters using an example dataset and, subsequently instructions are given how to obtain parameters using your own data.},

abstract = {Polar organic micropollutants (MPs) can have ecotmdcological effects on aquatic ecosystems and their occurrence in drinking water is a threat to public health. An extensive exposure assessment of MPs in large river and lake catchments is a necessary but challenging proposition for researchers and regulators. To get a complete picture of MP exposure in a large catchment, we employed a novel integrated strategy including MP measurement in the international catchment of Lake Constance and mass-flux modeling. A comprehensive screening of 252 MPs in the lake water by high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify the most commonly present MPs for the study site It was found that the wastewater borne MPs diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfarnethoxazole, acesulfame, sucralose, benzotriazole, and methylbenzotriazole accounted for the most frequent and prominent findings The concentration pattern of these compounds in the catchment was calculated based on regionalized inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WVVTPs) and substance specific elimination rates. In 52, 8, and 3 of the 112 investigated river locations the concentration exceeded the predicted no effect levels for diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, respectively. By coupling the catchment and lake model the effect of future trends in usage as well as possible mitigation options were evaluated for the tributaries and the lake. The upgrade of the major WWITs in the catchment with a postozonation step would lead to a load reduction between 32{\%} and 52{\%} for all substances except for sucralose (10{\%}).},

abstract = {The interaction between rain drops and crop canopies changes the microphysical characteristics of precipitation. Understanding the mechanisms driving these changes is a key step towards unveiling the mechanics of soil water recharge, soil erosion under crop canopies, and evaporation of intercepted rainfall. The latter caused by, for example, the reduced aerodynamic resistance to evaporation of splashed droplets. We propose a model that uses drop-size and velocity distributions as well as the three-dimensional geometry of the maize canopy to simulate the movement of raindrops on the surface of the leaves. The model accounts for the interception, redirection, retention, coalescence, and re-interception of drops to predict the location, size, and velocity of throughfall drops beneath the canopy. The throughfall results are presented as two-dimensional matrices, in which each term corresponds to the accumulated volume of drops that dripped in that location, which offers insight into its spatial distribution under the foliage. We examine the modification of the drop-size distribution by the maize canopy by recalculating the drop velocity based on their size and detachment height. They built the three-dimensional digital canopy that is employed in the simulation by creating modified copies of one photogrammetry-generated digital model of a plant located inside their experimental site. The canopy model accounts for the projected overlap of the single plant leaves. We evaluate the results against measurements obtained during 10 storms that occurred between 14 July 2009 and 28 August 2009 in Shueyville, Iowa. The comparison between observations and simulations corroborates the drop detachment threshold of 3.75. mm and indicates that splashing, as opposed to considering solely the rolling or bouncing of droplets that lack the kinetic energy to attach to the foliage, is the likely source of throughfall drops with diameters smaller than 1. mm. The predicted throughfall spatial distribution unveils localized dripping points, which pose a challenge to the correct sampling of throughfall. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In most of these applications, prior knowledge about the phenomenon being modelled is available. This knowledge allows us to formulate Bayesian models, that is prior distributions for the unknown quantities and likelihood functions relating these quantities to the observations. Within this setting, all inference on the unknown quantities is based on the posterior distribution obtained from Bayes' theorem. Often, the observations arrive sequentially in time and one is interested in performing inference on-line. It is therefore necessary to update the posterior distribution as data become available. Examples include tracking an aircraft using radar measurements, estimating a digital communications signal using noisy measurements, or estimating the volatility of financial instruments using stock market data. Computational simplicity in the form of not having to store all the data might also be an additional motivating factor for sequential methods.},

abstract = {Pesticides, the most cost-effective means of pest and weed control, allow the maintenance of current yields and so contribute to economic viability. Concern about the environmental impact of repeated pesticide use has prompted research into the environmental fate of these agents, which can emigrate from treated fields to air, other land and waterbodies. How long the pesticide remains in the soil depends on how strongly it is bound by soil components and how readily it is degraded. It also depends on the environmental conditions at the time of application, e.g., soil water content. Pesticide use must ensure public safety and environmental protection with regards to both the chemical itself and their potentially harmful metabolites. This paper reviews what is known of the influence of the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil system, such as moisture content, organic matter and clay contents, and pH, on the sorption/desorption and degradation of pesticides and their access to groundwater and surface waters. An understanding of the fate of pesticides is essential for rational decision-taking regarding their authorization. To reach an adequate understanding will require the concourse of soil science, clay mineralogy, physical chemistry, surface chemistry, environmental microbiology, plant physiology and, no doubt, other disciplines. Only through a multidisciplinary approach to environmental research will it be possible to plan, manage, pursue and integrate the results of the studies that will be necessary for the development of tools and techniques allowing effective environmental decision-making. There seems to be a great potential to develop microbially derived pesticides, which are effective, reliable and have a low environmental risk. In addition, new application techniques, for example precision band spraying, can reduce the dose, which can be a very effective way to minimize transport and emission but also to avoid a build-up of resistance in target organisms. Improved formulations will also be needed to reduce off-target deposition, improve retention on target, and enhance uptake and translocation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pesticide runoff is an important contributor to surface-water contamination. Transfer conditions at the field scale are well known, but our understanding is still quite limited in assessing water contamination by pesticides at the catchment scale. In this study, we focused on the spatial arrangement of agricultural practices in small catchments ({\textless}1 km2) and its impact on surface-water quality with respect to pesticide losses. An innovative method, the conjugation of mechanistic modeling and supervised-learning, was used to simplify this complex situation of pesticide transfer at the catchment scale. At the catchment level, the connectivity between each field and the hydraulic network is a major factor in determining the transfer of pesticides from fields to the outlet. We propose a connectivity indicator that assesses the contribution of each field to the hydraulic network runoff flow, which can be interpreted as the impact of each field on the catchment water quality. The connectivity indicator was inferred from the results of a mechanistic model simulation. First, we constructed a database from simulations using a proven hydrological model (MHYDAS) with defined scenarios. Then, two-thirds of the data were processed by the REPtree method to yield a regression tree. The rules obtained by this tree formed the basis for the connectivity indicator. The tree was then validated using the last third of the simulated data and the connectivity indicator was applied to a small wine-growing catchment in Roujan, France. This indicator required several types of data for its calculation: a spatial mapping of the studied watershed (topography, field characteristics, and network distribution) and an estimation of the spatial distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity. The indicator developed here can be used to carry out risk assessments for diffuse pollution in diagnostics as well as test-mitigation strategies. The assessment results can be represented as a risk map to facilitate their interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Traveltimes from infiltration area to sampling points were determined with chloride and tritium, and used to place the 3D field-observations in the 1D column-model. Values for CEC were variable for seven layers in the model. Infiltration of pretreated Rhine water in the dune aquifer can be considered an intrusion of more saline water. It caused desorption of Ca2+, in exchange for Na+, K+ and Mg2+ from Rhine water. Because of variations in total solute concentrations in infiltration water, local small scale freshening fronts (Ca2+ sorption, Na+ desorption) were created by seasonally decreasing salt concentrations. The undersaturation with respect to calcite in the infiltration water, and the CO2 produced during consumption of oxygen, resulted in dissolution of calcite. Precipitation of calcite occurred in response to desorption of calcium from the exchanger in the downstream parts. Overall, a net dissolution of calcite was simulated good results were generally achieved for all components: sulfate, nitrate, chloride, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, 3H and O2. The contributions of the different geochemical reactions to the water quality are illustrated with computer simulations for the individual processes.},

abstract = {The topographic wetness index (TWI, ln(a/tan )), which combines local upslope contributing area and slope, is commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes. Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.},

The LCAs suggest that constructed wetlands have less environmental impact, in terms of resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The VFCW is a less impactful configuration for removing total nitrogen from domestic wastewater. Both wetland designs have negligible impacts on respiratory organics, radiation and ozone. Gaseous emissions, often not included in wastewater LCAs because of lack of data or lack of agreement on impacts, have the largest impact on climate change. Nitrous oxide accounts for the increase in impact on respiratory inorganic, and the combined acidification/eutrophication category. The LCAs were used to assess the importance of nitrogen removal and recycling, and the potential for optimizing nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The biodegradation pathways of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) and 1,1,2-trichloroethane (112TCA) and the associated microbial communities in anaerobic wetland sediments were evaluated using concurrent geochemical and genetic analyses over time in laboratory microcosm experiments. Experimental results were compared to in situ porewater data in the wetland to better understand the factors controlling daughter product distributions in a chlorinated solvent plume discharging to a freshwater tidal wetland at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Microcosms constructed with wetland sediment from two sites showed little difference in the initial degradation steps of TeCA, which included simultaneous hydrogenolysis to 112TCA and dichloroelimination to 1,2-dichloroethene (12DCE). The microcosms from the two sites showed a substantial difference, however, in the relative dominance of subsequent dichloroelimination of 112TCA. A greater dominance of 112TCA dichloroelimination in microcosms constructed with sediment that was initially iron-reducing and subsequently simultaneously iron-reducing and methanogenic caused approximately twice as much vinyl chloride (VC) production as microcosms constructed with sediment that was methanogenic only throughout the incubation. The microcosms with higher VC production also showed substantially more rapid VC degradation. Field measurements of redox-sensitive constituents, TeCA, and its anaerobic degradation products along flowpaths in the wetland porewater also showed greater production and degradation of VC with concurrent methanogenesis and iron reduction. Molecular fingerprinting indicated that bacterial species [represented by a peak at a fragment size of 198 base pairs (bp) by MnlI digest] are associated with VC production from 112TCA dichloroelimination, whereas methanogens (190 and 307 bp) from the Methanococcales or Methanobacteriales family are associated with VC production from 12DCE hydrogenolysis. Acetate-utilizing methanogens (acetotrophs) appear to be involved in the biodegradation of VC. The relative abundance of Methanosarcinaceae, the only methanogen group with acetotrophic members, doubled in microcosms in which degradation of VC was observed. In addition, molecular analyses using primers specific for known dehalorespiring bacteria in the Dehalococcoides and Desulfuromonas groups showed the presence of these bacteria in microcosm slurry from the site that showed the highest VC production and degradation. Determination of biogeochemical controls and microbial consortia involved in TeCA degradation is leading to a better understanding of the heterogeneity in biodegradation rates and daughter product distribution in the wetland, improving capabilities for developing remediation and monitoring plans.},

abstract = {Overland flow is often only a few millimetres deep. Consequently, the potential for raindrop impact to affect flow hydraulics and sediment transport is high. Furthermore, the relative importance of rainfall impact is highest for shallow low-energy flows on low slopes. In such flows net sediment deposition may occur. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to study sediment deposition in the presence of rainfall over a range of hydraulic conditions. In order to investigate the impact of raindrops on sediment deposition by overland flow, these experimental data were compared to the experimental data collected in the absence of raindrop impact. Comparison of the experimental data shows that raindrop impact retards the flow velocity and has a clear positive effect on sediment delivery. Under rainfall significantly more coarse sediment is transported over areas of net sediment deposition. Subsequently, the experimental results are used to evaluate a multi-class net deposition theory, describing sediment transport and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition in the presence of both raindrop impact and flow-driven processes. The multi-class theory is calibrated using part of the experimental data. Evaluation of the model predictions using the other part of the data shows that the optimised model is able to accurately predict sediment delivery and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Riparian zones have been investigated in order to determine the processes that control the removal of agriculturally derived nitrate from groundwater; however, many gaps exist in our understanding of the functioning of riparian zones as regulators of nitrate fluxes in shallow groundwater. In this study, a reactive-transport model is applied to simulate organic carbon, nitrate, and nitrogen isotope behavior during denitrification in a river riparian zone. The model includes the reactive-transport processes presented by MacQuarrie and Sudicky [J. Contam. Hydrol. 47 (2001) 53], but has been extended to compute nitrogen isotope fractionation during biogeochemical reactions. Numerical simulation results have been compared to field data from a well-characterized river riparian aquifer and the comparison shows that the model captures the essential reactive-transport processes for major reactive species, including ??15N. A surficial peat zone is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the supply of this DOC to underlying sands and gravels by hydrodynamic processes controls the denitrification of upland nitrate flowing into the riparian zone. The model results support the previously proposed conceptual models for denitrification in riparian aquifers in that enriched ??15N, declining DOC, and declining groundwater NO 3
--N concentrations all occur within a relatively thin (1.5 m) zone. The simulated isotope enrichment factors for selected locations within the model domain range from -2{\%} to -8???, and it is noted that these values are significantly lower than the value specified in the model input. This suggests that it would be very difficult to derive accurate isotopic enrichment factors from a limited number of piezometers in such riparian aquifers. Numerical sensitivity analyses show that denitrification can occur at depths as great as 4 m below the ground surface, but the overall nitrate mass removal capacity of the riparian zone will decrease as the groundwater flow system becomes thicker. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a mechanistic, compartmental simulation model of subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. The model consists of six submodels, including the nitrogen and carbon cycles, both autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria growth and metabolism, and water and oxygen balances. Data from an existing constructed wetland in Maryland were used to calibrate the model. Model results reproduced seasonal trends well. Interactions between the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen cycles were evident in model output. In general, effluent biochemical oxygen demand, organic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate concentrations were predicted well. Because little is known about rootzone aeration by wetland plants, oxygen predictions were fair. The model is generally insensitive to changes in individual parameters. This is due to the complexity of the ecosystem and the model, as well as the numerous feedback mechanisms. The model is most sensitive to changes in parameters that affect microbial growth and substrate use directly. This dynamic, compartmental, simulation model is an effective tool for evaluating the performance of subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. The model provided insights into treatment problems at an existing constructed wetland. With further evaluation and refinement, the model will be a useful design tool for subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Environmental degradation of organic micropollutants is difficult to monitor due to their diffuse and ubiquitous input. Current approaches-concentration measurements over time, or daughter-to-parent compound ratios-may fall short, because they do not consider dilution, compound-specific sorption characteristics or alternative degradation pathways. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) offers an alternative approach based on evidence from isotope values. Until now, however, the relatively high limits for precise isotope analysis by gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) have impeded CSIA of sub-microgram-per-liter scale micropollutant concentrations in field samples. This study presents the first measurements of C and N isotope ratios of the herbicide atrazine and its metabolite desethylatrazine at concentrations of 100 to 1,000 ng/L in natural groundwater samples. Solid-phase extraction and preparative HPLC were tested and validated for preconcentration and cleanup of groundwater samples of up to 10 L without bias by isotope effects. Matrix interferences after solid-phase extraction could be greatly reduced by a preparative HPLC cleanup step prior to GC-IRMS analysis. Sensitivity was increased by a factor of 6 to 8 by changing the injection method from large-volume to cold-on-column injection on the GC-IRMS system. Carbon and nitrogen isotope values of field samples showed no obvious correlation with concentrations or desethylatrazine-to-atrazine ratios. Contrary to expectations, however, $\delta$ (13) C values of desethylatrazine were consistently less negative than those of atrazine from the same sites.

abstract = {The paper focusses on connectivity in the context of infiltration-excess overland flow and its integrated response as slope-base overland flow hydrographs. Overland flow is simulated on a sloping surface with some minor topographic expression and spatially differing infiltration rates. In each cell of a 128 × 128 grid, water from upslope is combined with incident rainfall to generate local overland flow, which is stochastically routed downslope, partitioning the flow between downslope neighbours. Simulations show the evolution of connectivity during simple storms. As a first approximation, total storm runoff is similar everywhere, discharge increasing proportionally with drainage area. Moderate differences in plan topography appear to have only a second-order impact on hydrograph form and runoff amount. Total storm response is expressed as total runoff, runoff coefficient or total volume infiltrated; each plotted against total storm rainfall, and allowing variations in average gradient, overland flow roughness, infiltration rate and storm duration. A one-parameter algebraic expression is proposed that fits simulation results for total runoff, has appropriate asymptotic behaviour and responds rationally to the variables tested. Slope length is seen to influence connectivity, expressed as a scale distance that increases with storm magnitude and can be explicitly incorporated into the expression to indicate runoff response to simple events as a function of storm size, storm duration, slope length and gradient. The model has also been applied to a 10-year rainfall record, using both hourly and daily time steps, and the implications explored for coarser scale models. Initial trails incorporating erosion continuously update topography and suggest that successive storms produce an initial increase in erosion as rilling develops, while runoff totals are only slightly modified. Other factors not yet considered include the dynamics of soil crusting and vegetation growth. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The development of a physically based model to simulate the transport of soil solutes in runoff has provided a better understanding of the mechanisms of transport and has assisted in the development of effective methods to control nutrient loss from soils and the pollution of waterways. A refined model has been applied to experimental data in which the presumed exchange layer was replaced by a mixing zone. Assuming that the exchange rate is controlled by raindrop splash, the effects of diffusion can be neglected and the exchange rate, km, can be replaced by the variable er, the raindrop-induced water transfer rate, removing the need to calibrate km. To calibrate our model, laboratory experiments were conducted on disturbed loessial soil with three initial soil-moisture contents (5{\%}, 15{\%}, and 20{\%}, measured gravimetrically) under three rainfall intensities (60, 96, and 129mmh-1) and three slope gradients (5, 15, and 25°). The model's simulated data agreed well with the experimental data, demonstrating that the refined model captured the temporal behaviour of solute transport in the runoff. This study provides a new approach to the modelling of chemical transport by investigating the effects of raindrops on sediments from soil in surface runoff. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The survey reveals a complex hydrologic regime with systematic variability in water balance due to local site characteristics. On average, runoff to lakes in wetland-dominated catchments is found to be significantly higher than runoff to upland-dominated lakes, with generally higher contributions from catchments with low bog/fen ratios. The isotope method, which relies primarily on water sampling and isotopic analysis, can be easily integrated in routine water quality surveys and is shown to be a practical alternative to conventional hydrological modelling for comparative analysis of water balance controls on hydrochemistry and aquatic ecology of lakes, particularly in low-relief wetland-rich terrain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {How can leaching risk be assessed if the chemical flux and/or the toxicity is highly uncertain? For many strongly sorbing pesticides it is known that their transport through the unsaturated zone occurs intermittently through preferential flow, triggered by significant rainfall events. In these circumstances the timing and frequency of these rainfall events may allow quantification of leaching risk to overcome the limitations of flux prediction. In this paper we analyze the leaching behavior of bromide and two herbicides, methabenzthiazuron and ethidimuron, using data from twelve uncropped lysimeters, with high-resolution climate data, in order to identify the rainfall controls on rapid solute leaching. A regression tree analysis suggested that a coarse-scale fortnightly to monthly water balance was a good predictor of short-term increases in drainage and bromide transport. Significant short-term herbicide leaching, however, was better predicted by the occurrence of a single storm with a depth greater than a 19 mm threshold. Sampling periods where rain events exceeded this threshold accounted for between 38{\%} and 56{\%} of the total mass of herbicides leached during the experiment. The same threshold only accounted for between 1{\%} and 10{\%} of the total mass of bromide leached. On the basis of these results, we conclude that in this system, the leaching risks of strongly sorbing chemicals can be quantified by the timing and frequency of these large rainfall events. Empirical and modeling approaches are suggested to apply this frequentist approach to leaching risk assessment to other soil-climate systems.},

abstract = {Numerical models are a means to increase the understanding of the processes occurring in the "black box" constructed wetland. Once reliable models for constructed wetlands are available they can be also used for evaluating and improving existing design criteria. The paper shows simulation results for outdoor experimental subsurface vertical flow constructed wetlands using CW2D, a multi-component reactive transport module developed to simulate transport and reactions of the organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The surface area of the experimental vertical flow bed was 20 m(2). The organic load applied was 27 g COD m(-2) d(-1) (corresponding to a specific surface area of 3 m(2) per person). The aim of the work is to calibrate the model for temperature dependency that has been implemented in CW2D. Water temperature during the investigation period varied between 4 degrees C and 18 degrees C. The measured effluent concentrations during summer could be simulated using the standard CW2D parameter set when the flow model was calibrated well. However, the increasing effluent concentrations at low temperatures could not be simulated with the standard CW2D parameter set where temperature dependencies are considered only for maximum growth, decay, and hydrolysis rates. By introducing temperature dependencies for half-saturation constants for the hydrolysis and nitrification processes it was possible to simulate the observed behaviour. The work presented is a step on the way to validate the CW2D module. Model validation is a necessary step before numerical simulation can be finally used in practice, e.g. for checking existing design guidelines.},

abstract = {This review identifies understudied areas of emerging contaminant (EC) research in wastewaters and the environment, and recommends direction for future monitoring. Non-regulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and personal care products are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e.g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative data is attained and facilitates a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, there is a lack of suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e.g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment.},

abstract = {Nitrate is naturally found within the environment as part of the nitrogen cycle. However, anthropogenic inputs have greatly increased nitrate loads within ground and surface waters. This has had a severe impact on aquatic ecosystems and has given rise to health considerations in humans and livestock. Therefore, the identification of nitrate sources is important in preserving water quality and achieving sustainability of our water resources. Nitrate sources can be determined based on the nitrate nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic compositions (?? 15N, ?? 18O). However, sewage and manure have overlapping ?? 15N and ?? 18O values making their differentiation on this basis problematic. The specific differentiation between sources of faecal contamination is of particular importance, because the risk to humans is usually considered higher from human faecal contamination (sewage) than from animal faecal contamination. This review summarises the current state of knowledge in using isotope tracers to differentiate various nitrate sources and identifies potential chemical tracers for differentiating sewage and manure. In particular, an in depth review of the current state of knowledge regarding the necessary considerations in using chemical markers, such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, to differentiate sewage and manure sources of nitrate contamination will be given, through an understanding of their use, occurrence and fate, in order to identify the most suitable potential chemical markers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In other words, the sorption process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics at high initial concentration of solute, while it obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics model at lower initial concentration of solute. The theoretical results (derived equations) show that the observed rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are combinations of adsorption and desorption rate constants and also initial concentration of solute. The obtained theoretical equations are used to correlate experimental data for sorption kinetics of some solutes on various sorbents.

This culture was amended with [U-13C]toluene and served as a model system to elucidate the flux of carbon in the food chain by quantifying bacterial biovolumes and 13C enrichment of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers of the bacteria and the heterotrophic protists. Major PLFA detected in the batch co-culture included those derived from Pseudomonas sp. PS+ (16:1??7c and 18:1??7c) and Vahlkampfia sp. (20:4??6c and 20:3??6c). A numerical model including consumption of toluene by the bacteria and predation of the bacteria by the heterotrophic protists was adjsuted to the measured toluene carbon, bacterial carbon and ??13C values of bacterial and protist biomass. Using this model, we estimated that 28??7{\%} of the consumed toluene carbon was transformed into bacterial biomass, and 12??4{\%} of the predated bacterial carbon was incorporated into heterotrophic protist biomass. Our study showed that the 13C enrichment of PLFA biomarkers coupled to biomass determination via biovolume calculations is a suitable method to trace carbon fluxes in protist-inclusive microbial food chains because it does not require the separation of protist cells from bacterial cells and soil particles. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The geostatistical properties of soil moisture patterns from five different sites in Australia (Tarrawarra and Point Nepean) and New Zealand (three sites from the Mahurangi River Basin - Carran's, Clayden's and Satellite Station) are analysed here. The soil moisture data were collected using time domain reflectometry and consistent methods for all sites, thereby allowing comparisons to be drawn between sites without the complication of methodological differences. The sites have contrasting climatic and soils characteristics. Soil moisture in the top 30 cm of the soil profile was measured using time domain reflectometry on 6-8 occasions at each site. The variance and correlation structure of the patterns was analysed. Typical correlation scales lie between 30 and 60 m. We found that there was a seasonal evolution in the spatial soil moisture variance that was related to changes in the spatial mean moisture content at all sites. At the Australian sites there was also a seasonal evolution in the correlation length related to changes in the spatial mean moisture, but not at the New Zealand sites. The seasonal evolution of the correlation length in the Australian catchments is likely to be associated with a seasonal change in the processes controlling the soil moisture pattern. The more humid climate at the New Zealand sites leads to more consistent spatial controls over the year. Similarities between the correlation structure of the moisture and topographic indices representing lateral flow and topographically modulated evaporative forcing were found at Tarrawarra, Carran's and Clayden's. At Point Nepean the correlation structure of the soil moisture pattern is controlled by a larger (than the topography) scale variation in soils, properties and at Satellite Station a smaller scale source of variability is apparent in the data (although there were also topographical effects apparent, associated with valley features). The results demonstrate that the processes controlling spatial patterns can change between places and over time with catchment moisture status; however, when similar general conditions reoccur in a catchment, similar spatial patterns result. Soil characteristics and climate do provide a general pointer to what we might expect but the results also show subtleties specific to place. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phytoremediation is a promising technology for the cleanup of polluted environments. The technology has so far been used mainly to remove toxic heavy metals from contaminated soil, but there is a growing interest in broadening its applications to remove/degrade organic pollutants in the environment. Both plants and soil microorganisms have certain limitations with respect to their individual abilities to remove/breakdown organic compounds. A synergistic action by both rhizosphere microorganisms that leads to increased availability of hydrophobic compounds, and plants that leads to their removal and/or degradation, may overcome many of the limitations, and thus provide a useful basis for enhancing remediation of contaminated environments. MAIN FEATURES: The review of literature presented in this article provides an insight to the nature of plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere, with a focus on those processes that are relevant to the breakdown and/or removal of organic pollutants. Due consideration has been given to identify opportunities for utilising the plant-microbial synergy in the rhizosphere to enhance remediation of contaminated environments, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature review has highlighted the existence of a synergistic interaction between plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This interaction benefits both microorganisms through provision of nutrients by root exudates, and plants through enhanced nutrient uptake and reduced toxicity of soil contaminants. The ability of the plant-microbial interaction to tackle some of the most recalcitrant organic chemicals is of particular interest with regard to enhancing and extending the scope of remediation technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere offer very useful means for remediating environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic compounds. OUTLOOK: A better knowledge of plant-microbial interactions will provide a basis for improving the efficacy of biological remediations. Further research is, however, needed to investigate different feedback mechanisms that select and regulate microbial activity in the rhizosphere.},

abstract = {Production of 14CO2 from [1,2-14C] dichloroethene (DCE) or [1,2-14C] vinyl chloride (VC) was quantified in aquifer and stream-bed sediment microcosms to evaluate the potential for microbial mineralization as a pathway for DCE and VC biodegradation under aerobic, Fe(III)-reducing, SO4-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Mineralization of [1,2-14C] DCE and [1,2-14C] VC to 14CO2 decreased under increasingly reducing conditions, but significant mineralization was observed for both sediments even under anaerobic conditions. VC mineralization decreased in the order of aerobic {\textgreater} Fe(III)-reducing {\textgreater} SO4-reducing {\textgreater} methanogenic conditions. For both sediments, VC mineralization was greater than DCE mineralization under all electron-accepting conditions examined. For both sediments, DCE mineralization was at least two times greater under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions. Although significant microbial mineralization of DCE was observed under anaerobic conditions, recovery of 14CO2 did not differ substantially between anaerobic treatments.},

abstract = {Stormwater is a major driving factor of aquatic ecosystem degradation as well as one of the largest untapped urban freshwater resources. We present results from a long-term, multi-catchment study of urban stormwater pesticides across Australia that addresses this dichotomous identity (threat and resource), as well as dominant spatial and temporal patterns in stormwater pesticide composition. Of the 27 pesticides monitored, only 19 were detected in Australian stormwater, five of which (diuron, MCPA, 2,4-D, simazine, and triclopyr) were found in {\textgreater}50{\%} of samples. Overall, stormwater pesticide concentrations were lower than reported in other countries (including the United States, Canada and Europe), and exceedances of public health and aquatic ecosystem standards were rare (10{\%} of samples). Spatio-temporal patterns were investigated with principal component analysis. Although stormwater pesticide composition was relatively stable across seasons and years, it varied significantly by catchment. Common pesticide associations appear to reflect 1) user application of common registered formulations containing characteristic suites of active ingredients, and 2) pesticide fate properties (e.g., environmental mobility and persistence). Importantly, catchment-specific occurrence patterns provide opportunities for focusing treatment approaches or stormwater harvesting strategies.},
