## Temperature

Temperture is an important parameter regulating chemical and biological processes. To simulate its evolution across time and space this model follows [@Nietsch2009], where the average daily soil temperature ($^{\circ}$C) at the center of each soil layer is given by:

$$
T_{soil, k, t} = l \cdot T_{soil, k, t-1} + (1.0 - l) \cdot \big[df \cdot [\overline{T}_{AAir} - T_{ssurf}]+T_{ssurf}]
$$

where $l$ is a lag coefficient (0 - 1.0) regulating the influence of the previous day's temperature, the subscript $t-1$, refers to the previous day, $df$ is a depth factor, $\overline{T}_{AAir}$ is the average annual air temperature and $T_{ssurf}$ is the soil surface temperature at time $t$.
