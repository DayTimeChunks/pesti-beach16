1. What is the topic of my paper?

The topic of my paper is the development of a reactive transport numerical model for understanding and predicting pesticide fate at the catchment scale.  

2. Why is this topic important?

This topic is important to the development of pesticide evaluation programs seeking to improve quantitative mechanistic understanding of pesticide degradation, persistence and potential mobility from source soils to non-target environmental receptors. Although detailed numerical models have been developed for this purpose (e.g. PEARL), limitations persist either in terms of dimensionality capabilities (1D vs. multi-dimensionality) or agriculturally relevant near-surface process representation (such as plant physiological and soil's physical development). More importantly, current models rely on dissipation parameters where a direct quantitative estimation of biogeochemical transformation processes cannot be distinguished from competing non-destructive dilution processes regulating environmental concentrations. The integration of CSIA as a complementary tool as predictive model constraints should lead to the improvement of estimation of pesticide transfer potential in field and catchment studies.
